Endurance Walking in the Health, Aging and Body Composition Study

ABSTRACT

5

Objectives: To determine whether lower extremity sensorimotor peripheral nerve deficits are

6

associated with reduced walking endurance in older adults.

7

Design: Prospective cohort study with six years of follow-up.

Setting: Two U.S. clinical sites in (Pittsburgh, PA and Memphis, TN).

Composition study from the 2000/01 annual clinical examination (n=2393; age 76.5 ± 2.9 years;

11

48.2% male; 38.2% black) and subset with longitudinal data (n=1,178).

12

Interventions: Not applicable

13

Main Outcome Measures: Participants underwent peripheral nerve function examination in

14

2000/01, including peroneal motor nerve conduction amplitude and velocity, vibration perception

15

threshold, and monofilament testing. Symptoms of lower-extremity peripheral neuropathy

16

included numbness or tingling and sudden stabbing, burning, pain, or aches in the feet or legs.

17

The long distance corridor walk (LDCW; 400m) was administered in 2000/01 and every two

18

years afterwards for 6 years to assess endurance walking performance over time.

19

Results: In separate fully adjusted linear mixed models poor vibration threshold (>130

20

microns), 10-g and 1.4-g monofilament insensitivity were each associated with slower LDCW

21

completion time (16.0, 14.1, and 6.7, seconds slower, respectively, P<.05 for each). Poor motor

22

amplitude (<1mV), poor vibration perception threshold, and 10-g monofilament insensitivity were

23

related to greater slowing/year (4.7, 4.3, and 4.3 additional seconds/year, respectively, P<.05),

24

though poor motor amplitude was not associated with initial completion time.

25

Conclusions: Poorer sensorimotor peripheral nerve function is related to slower endurance

26

walking and greater slowing longitudinally. Interventions to reduce the burden of sensorimotor

Sensorimotor peripheral nerve function deficits are common in older adults, even in the
absence of diabetes.1-3 In the Health, Aging, and Body Composition Study (Health ABC), recent

35

work indicated that 55% of mobility-intact older adults (N=1,680; age 76.5 ± 2.9 years) at the

36

2000/01 examination had evidence of lower extremity peripheral nerve impairment.3 Poor

37

peripheral nerve function in older adults is associated with worse lower extremity function,4-7

38

quadriceps and ankle dorsiflexion strength,8,9 falls,10-13 and lower extremity mobility limitations.3

39

Worse lower extremity sensation and motor control resulting from sensorimotor peripheral nerve

40

dysfunction can lead to altered gait mechanics and inefficient and unstable gait patterns.14-19

41

Additionally, symptoms related to peripheral nerve impairments—including lower extremity pain

42

or numbness—may make weight-bearing activities like walking difficult.

Walking endurance—the ability to walk for a sustained time or distance—is important for

44

independence and remaining active in the community. Though aerobic fitness plays a major role

45

in endurance walking, factors like peripheral nerve function may influence walking endurance

46

over time, particularly given their impact on lower extremity function. However, work has been

47

limited in exploring the impact of peripheral nerve impairments on walking endurance.

Evidence exists that walking endurance is worse in diabetic adults compared to non-

49

diabetic healthy adults20 and also in the in the presence of a greater burden of lower extremity

50

complications from diabetic peripheral neuropathy.21 In the InCHIANTI study, motor nerve

51

conduction velocity was cross-sectionally associated with slower completion of a fast-paced

52

400m walking test for older diabetic and non-diabetic adults.22 Ideally, both motor and sensory

53

nerve assessments and symptoms should be included to examine the full range of peripheral

54

nerve function, not only clinical disease.23 Furthermore, no longitudinal studies have examined

55

if peripheral nerve function contributes to decline in endurance walking over time in old age.
This study aimed to: 1) examine whether worse sensorimotor peripheral nerve function

56

is cross-sectionally related to poorer endurance walking in older adults, and 2) determine

58

whether worse sensorimotor peripheral nerve function is associated with greater slowing

60

Participants were from Health ABC, a longitudinal cohort study of community-dwelling
older adults (n=3075; age 70-79; 48.4% male; 41.6% black at baseline) from Pittsburgh, PA and

65

Memphis, TN aimed at investigating factors related to the development of functional limitation

66

and disability.24 Participants had to self-report having no difficulty in walking ¼ mile, climbing 10

67

steps, or any basic activity of daily living; be free of any life-threatening cancers; and plan to

68

remain in the study area for at least three years. Participants completed the baseline visit

69

between April 1997 and June 1998 and provided written informed consent. In 2000/01, 2,404

70

participants had a clinic visit, with 2393 having complete nerve function and endurance walking

71

data (Figure 1). All study protocols were approved by institutional review boards at the

72

University of Pittsburgh and University of Tennessee Health Science Center.

Lower extremity sensory and motor nerve function was assessed in 2000/01 by a trained

75

examiner. Motor nerve function was measured objectively using amplitude (millivolts) and

76

conduction velocity (m/sec) of the peroneal motor response as previously described.25

77

Stimulation occurred at the popliteal fossa and ankle using the NeuroMax 8a. Sensory nerve

78

function was measured using vibration detection threshold and monofilament testing. Vibration

detection threshold (in microns) was measured at the bottom of the great toe with a VSA-3000

80

Vibratory Sensory Analyzerb. Monofilament insensitivity was defined as the inability to detect

81

three of four touches at the dorsum of the large toe with a standard 10-g and light 1.4-g

82

monofilamentc. Feet were warmed to 30°C, and measures were perf ormed on the right unless

83

contraindicated due to knee replacement, amputation, trauma, ulcer, or recent surgery, in which

84

case the left side was tested unless also contraindicated. Clinically meaningful cut-points of

85

motor amplitude <1 mV, conduction velocity <40 m/sec,26 or vibration threshold >130were used

86

to define impairment, . These cut-points were previously used by Ward and are related to

87

quadriceps strength declines over time9 and incident mobility limitation.3

Endurance Walking

The long distance corridor walk (LDCW) was administered in 2000/01 and follow-up

92

visits in 2002/03, 2004/05 and 2006/07 to assess walking endurance.27 Exclusion criteria

94

included: systolic blood pressure >200 mmHg, resting pulse of ≥120 beats per minute, presence

95

of an electrocardiogram abnormality, cardiac surgery, worsening of chest pain or shortness of

96

breath in the prior three months. This test included minute warm-up where the participant was

97

to “cover as much ground as possible” for two minutes followed by the LDCW performed “as

98

quickly as possible at a pace that can be maintained for 400 meters.”28 Completion time for the

99

400m portion was recorded and used for analysis. Participants walked 10 laps around traffic

100

cones placed 20m apart for a total of 400 meters. Heart rate was recorded for each lap and

101

blood pressure was measured at the end of the test. The test was stopped if heart rate

102

surpassed 135 beats per minute, or for lightheadedness, dizziness, chest pain, shortness of

103

breath or leg pain.

portion in >7 minutes, and completing in ≤7 minutes. The aerobic fitness validation study of the

LDCW indicated that requiring >7 minutes is potentially indicative of significant functional

132

limitations.27 Descriptive statistics were expressed using proportions for categorical variables

133

and mean ± SD for continuous variables. Tests of trend were used to assess differences in

134

characteristics and peripheral nerve function across groups. Linear mixed-effects models

135

assessed the association between peripheral nerve function and greater slowing longitudinally

136

over six years of follow-up. Only participants who completed the LDCW in 2000/01 and at least

137

one follow-up could be included in the longitudinal models (n=1178, Figure 1). T-tests and chi-

138

squared tests were used to compare characteristics of those who were included in the

139

longitudinal models or not.

131

Some peripheral nerve function measures were moderately correlated and thus modeled
separately. The date of each Health ABC visit was used as the time parameter. Interaction

142

terms between each predictor and time indicate rate of change in 400m completion time over

143

the course of the study contributed by that predictor. Time-varying covariates were used for

144

factors that were updated throughout the study (physical activity, body composition). Models

145

were built progressively using forward stepwise techniques, initially retaining factors reaching a

146

significance of P<.10 or that appreciably attenuated the effect of peripheral nerve predictors.

147

We started with unadjusted models including peripheral nerve function and the interaction

148

between time and peripheral nerve function, and progressed by adding age, sex, race, site, and

149

body composition for a minimally adjusted model. We further adjusted for baseline health

150

status, lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), prevalent diseases,

151

and mental health and cognitive function variables as well as the time interactions for each of

152

these covariates. Only factors reaching a significance of P<.05 were retained in the final

153

parsimonious model. Because of the strong relationship between diabetes and peripheral nerve

154

function, diabetes was retained in the final model regardless of significance. In sensitivity

155

analyses, we tested the interaction between diabetes and peripheral nerve function, and we

156

also reran the linear mixed models excluding participants with diabetes. No structure was

RESULTS

Of the 2393 participants (age 76.5 ± 2.9 years; 48.2% male; 38.2% black), included in

164

165

complete the full LDCW, n=113 (4.7%) completed the 400m portion in >7 minutes, and 1528

166

participants (52.0%) completed in ≤7 minutes at the 2000/01 clinic visit. Significant trends

167

existed that those who completed the LDCW were slightly younger, were less likely to be female

models were not finishing the initial LDCW (n=407) or meeting exclusion criteria at the initial

183

LDCW assessment (n=345).
In longitudinal analyses, worse motor amplitude worse vibration threshold and poor

185

vibration threshold, 10-g and 1.4-g monofilament insensitivity were associated with 3.9, 5.2,

186

19.6, 9.3, and 20.7 seconds slower initial 400m walk completion time, respectively, when

187

adjusting for age, sex, race, site, height, and weight (Table 3; P<.05 for all). Relationships

188

were slightly attenuated after further adjusting for health habits and health conditions. Significant

189

relationships remained with the exception of lower motor amplitude (per SD poorer amplitude).

190

Poor vibration perception threshold was associated with completing the 400m walk 16.0

191

seconds slower and an additional 4.3 seconds of slowing per year compared to those with

192

vibration perception threshold ≤130 microns. Those with 10-g monofilament insensitivity

193

completed the 400m walk 14.1 seconds slower and slowed an additional 4.3 seconds each

194

year. Longitudinal endurance walking was not associated with either motor nerve conduction

195

velocity or symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. In sensitivity analyses, no significant interaction

196

existed between diabetes and peripheral nerve function. All results remained consistent after

197

excluding individuals with diabetes.

DISCUSSION

In this cohort of community-dwelling older adults, worse motor and sensory peripheral

C

199

EP

198

201

nerve function was related to worse endurance walking performance, and sensory nerve

202

impairments were associated with greater slowing longitudinally. Additionally, peripheral nerve

203

function and presence of symptoms of neuropathy were cross-sectionally related to the inability

204

to complete the initial LDCW. Though peripheral nerve impairments are often thought to be

205

primarily a concern for those with diabetes, these results support previous work indicating that

206

peripheral nerve function is an important predictor of mobility related outcomes in older adults

207

independent of diabetes.3,4

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

208

Vibration perception threshold and standard monofilament insensitivity were strongly
associated with the slowing of endurance walking over time. Sensory nerves detect touch,

210

vibration, and other sensations regarding the external environment, while motor nerves relay

211

signals from the central nervous system that allow for voluntary movement. Sensory nerve

212

function in the lower extremities is crucial for perception of joint position, posture, and balance—

213

all factors that play roles in walking quickly and efficiently. Worse vibration perception threshold

214

is associated with worse balance and slower usual gait speed in older adults without diabetes or

215

overt peripheral neuropathy.4,7,37

PT

209

Little work exists relating sensorimotor peripheral nerve function to endurance walking in

217

older adults. In InCHIANTI, slower motor nerve conduction velocity was associated with slower

218

completion of a fast-paced 400m walking test for older adults,22 though this study did not include

219

measures of motor nerve amplitude, sensory peripheral nerve function or the assessment of

220

symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. The association with conduction velocity is in contrast to

221

our results, though age and racial differences between the InCHIANTI and Health ABC cohorts

222

may have contributed to the differences in findings. Worse motor nerve amplitude (a sign of

223

axonal degeneration) but not worse motor nerve conduction velocity (a sign of demyelination)

224

have been shown to be associated with worse lower extremity physical performance,4 slower

225

usual gait speed4, and incident lower extremity limitation3 in Health ABC.

those of common risk factors associated with worse walking endurance. For example, current

229

slower, and cerebrovascular disease was associated with 16.1 seconds slower on the initial

230

400m walk, though neither were significantly associated with greater slowing over time. This is

231

similar to the effect of poor vibration perception threshold (16.0 seconds slower) and 10-g

232

monofilament insensitivity (14.1 seconds) on initial 400m walk completion time, which were

233

each related to greater slowing over time (4.3 seconds slower each).

234

Peripheral nerve impairments are common in older adults, 1 and improving functional
outcomes in those with these impairments may be important on many levels. Work in diabetic

236

populations has shown that worse lower extremity peripheral nerve function is associated with

237

altered gait biomechanics17-19,38 Because of the associations between gait alterations with

238

injuries and falls16,38-41 these factors may also be in the pathway to worse lower-extremity

239

function for older adults. Physical activity may help older adults delay persistent mobility

240

limitations,42 however, whether physical activity interventions may be used to reduce physical

241

functional impairments due to poor peripheral nerve function is currently unknown.

RI
PT

235

A major strength of this work is the inclusion of several measures of both motor and

243

sensory nerve function, as well as symptoms associated with peripheral neuropathy. Nerve

244

function deficits in older adults are commonly asymptomatic,1 making it particularly important to

245

include a variety objective and subjective measures. In addition, the large sample size and

246

longitudinal design allowed an examination of several factors that could potentially influence

247

peripheral nerve function and/or walking endurance over time.

CONCLUSIONS

RI
PT

263

Poorer sensory and motor peripheral nerve function in older adults is related to slower
endurance walking and greater slowing longitudinally over 6 years. Declines in endurance

266

walking likely contribute to the development of mobility limitations for those with sensorimotor

267

peripheral nerve impairments. Future work to reduce the burden of these impairments should

268

be considered to help older adults to maintain walking endurance—a crucial component for

269

community independence.

Beta values for continuous predictors represent the decrease/increase in LDCW completion
time based upon each standard deviation change representing worse nerve functioning.
Continuous nerve function mean ± SD of those in the longitudinal sample (n=1178): Amplitude =



3.6 ± 2.0 mV, conduction velocity = 43.7 ± 5.4, and vibration threshold = 49.5 ± 34.6.
Time interactions indicate the additional increase in LDCW completion time per year (change in
