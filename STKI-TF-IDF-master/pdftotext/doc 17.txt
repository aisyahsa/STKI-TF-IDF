This paper uses longitudinal data from China to examine the causal relationship between structural social
capital and health among Chinese older adults. We employ various econometric strategies to control for
the potential endogeneity of social capital and account for the possible contextual confounding effects by
including community-level social capital. We use three indicators to measure individuals’ general,
physical, and mental health. Results indicate that social capital has a signiﬁcant and positive effect on
general and physical health. Based on our primary IV ﬁndings, a one standard-deviation increase in social
capital leads to a 4.9 standard-deviation decrease in the probability of having bad health and a
2.2 standard-deviation decrease in physical activity limitations. Our results are robust to a series of
sensitivity checks. Further analysis suggests heterogeneous effects by age but not by gender or area of
residence.

1. Introduction
With increasing life expectancy and decreasing fertility rate,
population aging has become a global challenge in the 21st
century. The process of population aging is usually accompanied by
a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and disabilities among the
elderly, which may consequently reduce economic performance
and increase public health care expenditures (Sirven and Debrand,
2008). Among the various social policies instituted to cope with
the health challenges associated with aging, social capital has been
proposed as an important policy instrument (Oxley, 2009). The
positive relationship between social capital and health is observed
in many countries, for different measurements of social capital and
various indicators of health (Folland and Rocco, 2014). However,
there is no consensus on whether this relationship is causal and
how large it is. This discussion is of particular signiﬁcance to China
because China has the largest aging population and one of the

highest aging rates in the world today (Zhao et al., 2013). If social
capital does have a causal effect on the health of older adults in
China, then providing them with easier access to social interactions
and organizations will – in the long run – be a more effective health
promotion strategy than merely increasing public health care
expenditures.
Three possible mechanisms of why social capital may causally
lead to better health have been identiﬁed in the literature
(Schefﬂer and Brown, 2008; Folland, 2008). First, social capital
helps to buffer individuals’ mental stress by forming an environment that facilitates social interaction and builds mutual trust.
Second, social capital helps individuals obtain information on
health care and health, thus improving health production
efﬁciency. Third, social capital can generate a sense of shared
responsibility within families and communities and consequently
reduces the likelihood of risky behaviors such as drinking and
smoking.
The association between social capital and health has been
examined in a number of countries, including the US (Schultz et al.,
2008; Schefﬂer and Brown, 2008; Schefﬂer et al., 2007; Folland,
2007), Canada (Nakhaie and Arnold, 2010; Veenstra, 2000), the UK

(Rocco, 2014; Borgonovi, 2010; Snelgrove et al., 2009; Petrou and
Kupek, 2008; Poortinga, 2006b), Italy (Fiorillo and Sabatini, 2015),
the Nordic countries (Lindstrom, 2009; Lindstrom and Mohseni,
2009; Islam et al., 2008; Iversen, 2008), Europe as a whole (Rocco
et al., 2014; Ljunge, 2014; Sirven and Debrand, 2008, 2012; Rostila,
2007; Poortinga, 2006a), Japan (Murayama et al., 2013, 2015;
Yamamura, 2011a,b; Ichida et al., 2009; Fujisawa et al., 2009),
former Soviet Union countries (Goryakin et al., 2014; Habibov and
Afandi, 2011; D’Hombres et al., 2010; Ferlander and Mäkinen,
2009; Rose, 2000) and Latin American countries (Ronconi et al.,
2012; Hurtado et al., 2011). Despite many empirical arguments for
the positive association between social capital and health,
concerns over interpreting correlation as causation remain. First,
spurious correlation may be caused by omitted variables.
Unobserved heterogeneities such as time preference and personal
traits could drive both social capital and health to move in the same
direction. For example, people with low discount rates place high
value on future beneﬁts. These people are more likely to increase
investments in social capital and health concurrently. Second,
there may be reverse causality bias. On the one hand, people with
better health are both physically and ﬁnancially capable of
engaging in more social activities and thus have greater social
capital. On the other hand, people with relatively worse health may
have increased incentive to invest in social capital because their
opportunity cost of time is lower. Third, there may be measurement errors related to the subjective nature of self-reported health.
Although self-reported health is commonly used in the current
literature, misreporting bias still remains in the estimation. Fourth,
it is difﬁcult to distinguish social capital effects from other local
contextual effects that potentially inﬂuence health. Social capital
may vary between locations depending on the social and economic
characteristics of a community, which may confound the effect of
individual-level social capital on health (D’Hombres et al., 2010).
A number of studies have attempted to disentangle the causal
relationship between social capital and health by employing
several identiﬁcation strategies. These strategies include the use
of lagged values in longitudinal data to control for reverse
causality bias (Sirven and Debrand, 2012; Nakhaie and Arnold,
2010) and the instrumental variable (IV) approach (Fiorillo and
Sabatini, 2015; Ljunge, 2014; Rocco et al., 2014; Goryakin et al.,
2014; Yamamura, 2011b; D’Hombres et al., 2010; Schultz et al.,
2008). The most frequently used instrument is community-level
social capital. However, this instrument may not satisfy the
exclusion restriction condition because there may be possible
contextual effects of social capital on health at the community
level. Higher community-level social capital usually indicates a
better living environment, which could have a positive effect on
individuals’ health.
Our study aims to contribute to the literature in several
ways. First, this is the ﬁrst empirical study in the Chinese
context to examine the causal relationship between social
capital and health using national longitudinal data. Second, we
take into account the potential endogeneity resulting from
unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality by using ﬁxed
effects (FE) and IV estimators. Third, we account for the
possible contextual effects by including community-level social
capital. Fourth, we explore the heterogeneous effects of social
capital on health by gender, age, and area of residence. Our
study shows that structural social capital has a signiﬁcant and
positive effect on general and physical health but not on mental
health. The effect of social capital on physical health tends to be
stronger for older-old adults (aged 60 or above).
This paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant
literature. Section 3 describes the data and variables. Section 4
presents the empirical methodology. Section 5 reports results,
robustness checks, and heterogeneity. Section 6 concludes.

2. Literature review
2.1. The deﬁnition and measurement of social capital
The concept of social capital was ﬁrst put forward by Bourdieu
(1986) and further popularized by Coleman (1990) and Putnam
(2000). Despite some disputes on its deﬁnition, social capital is
commonly understood to encompass social networks, norms, and
trust that facilitate cooperation between individuals in a community (Putnam, 1993). Some researchers suggest that social capital
has cognitive and structural dimensions (Harpham et al., 2002).
Cognitive social capital relates to people’s perceptions of
interpersonal trust, solidarity and reciprocity, whereas structural
social capital refers to the extent and intensity of participation in
associations and other forms of social activity (Rostila, 2007).
Structural social capital is particularly conducive to generating the
beneﬁcial effects of social capital because participation in social
groups may facilitate the transmission of knowledge and increase
trust between members of society (Alesina and La Ferrara, 2000;
Putnam, 1993). Therefore, social participation is one of the most
frequently employed measures of social capital in the empirical
literature (Sirven and Debrand, 2008, 2012; Borgonovi, 2010; Berry
and Welsh, 2010; Ronconi et al., 2012).
2.2. Empirical studies on social capital and health
Although numerous studies have linked social capital to
positive health outcomes, the empirical relationship between
different forms of social capital and health is mixed at best. For
instance, with regard to the relationship between structural social
capital and health, some studies show a positive association
between social participation and health (Borgonovi, 2010; Berry
and Welsh, 2010; Petrou and Kupek, 2008), whereas others do not
ﬁnd such a relationship (Meng and Chen, 2014; Hurtado et al.,
2011; D’Hombres et al., 2010; Snelgrove et al., 2009; Yip et al.,
2007; Norstrand and Xu, 2012). Furthermore, some studies observe
that cognitive social capital is positively related to self-reported
health and that structural social capital is positively related to
somatic symptoms (Goryakin et al., 2014; Yamaoka, 2008).
As noted above, several studies use longitudinal data and an IV
approach to address the potential endogeneity of social capital.
Based on respective longitudinal data for Europe and Canada,
Sirven and Debrand (2012) and Nakhaie and Arnold (2010) use
lagged social capital instead of current social capital to control for
reverse causality bias. They both observe that social capital
contributes to better health. Using an IV approach, most studies
obtain larger coefﬁcient estimates on social capital than in the OLS
estimation. Folland (2007) uses state-level characteristics such as
employment per capita, geographic latitude, and state government
contributions to colleges per capita as IVs and ﬁnds social capital to
be highly correlated with a number of health measures in the US. In
their study on the US population, Schultz et al. (2008) use
residence years and religiosity variables as IVs. Their results
suggest that individual-level social capital is a signiﬁcant predictor
of self-rated health. A similar approach is followed by Yamamura
(2011b), who ﬁnds social capital to have a signiﬁcant and positive
inﬂuence on health for people without a job in Japan. Ronconi et al.
(2012) use transportation conditions as IVs and note a signiﬁcant
and positive relationship between social capital and health in
Argentina. Rocco et al. (2014) instrument social capital with crime
victimization and physician density in the community and obtain a
causal and positive relationship between social capital and health
in European countries. These ﬁndings are further conﬁrmed by
Fiorillo and Sabatini (2015),Goryakin et al. (2014) and D’Hombres
et al. (2010), who address the endogeneity issue by employing
community-level social capital as IVs. Ljunge (2014) uses ancestral

trust as an IV and detects a causal effect of trust on health in
Europe.
Only a few studies investigate the association between social
capital and health among older adults. Muckenhuber et al. (2013)
observe social capital to be signiﬁcantly more important for the
health of older people than for younger people in Austria. Sirven
and Debrand (2008, 2012) and Leone and Hessel (2015) report that
social capital improves health of older people in Europe.
Murayama et al. (2013) ﬁnd that social capital has beneﬁcial
effects on health of the older Japanese. Koutsogeorgou et al. (2014)
arrive at the conclusion that the association between social capital
and self-rated health among older adults differs in Poland, Finland,
and Spain.
In the Chinese context, Yip et al. (2007) are the ﬁrst to examine
the association between social capital and health. Their results
suggest that cognitive social capital (trust) is positively associated
with health, whereas structural social capital (organizational
membership) is not. Wang et al. (2009) use household survey data
from 22 villages in rural China and note that trust is positively
associated with general and mental health. Norstrand and Xu
(2012) observe no signiﬁcant relationship between social participation and physical and emotional health among older Chinese.
Meng and Chen (2014) document similar ﬁndings. The abovementioned studies on China suffer from three limitations. First,
these studies do not account for the potential biases caused by
unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality. Second, selfreported health is commonly used, and possible misreporting bias
may exist. Third, they fail to examine the heterogeneity underlying
the relationship between social capital and health in China.
3. Data, variables and descriptive statistics
3.1. Source of data
We use data from the 2008 and 2010 waves of the China Health
and Retirement Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS).1 CHARLS is a
comprehensive biennial survey aiming to collect detailed information about demographics, family, health, work, retirement and
pension from a nationally representative sample of Chinese

residents aged 45 and older. The survey was conducted by the
National School of Development at Peking University. Considering
the enormous complexity involved in a national survey, the
CHARLS team administered a pilot survey in Gansu and Zhejiang
Provinces (see Fig. 1) in 2008 and 2012. Wave 2008 was the ﬁrst
survey, and Wave 2012 was the follow-up survey. Gansu is a poor
inland province located in the less developed northwestern region,
and Zhejiang is a rich coastal province located in the developed
eastern region. In 2007, Gansu had a population of 26 million and
GDP per capita of 10,346 RMB (about 1642 USD), whereas Zhejiang
had a population of 50 million and GDP per capita of 37,411 RMB
(about 5398 USD) (National Statistical Bureau, 2008). The sharp
contrast between these two pilot provinces reﬂects the unbalanced
development and enormous diversity of China. The survey
followed a strict, multi-stage sampling process involving for four
levels: county, community, household, and respondent. The survey
collected data from 95 communities (villages) in 32 counties
(districts), covering 2685 individuals living in 1570 households. In
our analysis, the sample was restricted to respondents with nonmissing values.
3.2. Variables
3.2.1. Measuring health
Because health is a multi-dimensional and general concept, we
take a holistic approach and examine three health indicators:
general, physical and mental health. We ﬁrst use self-reported
health because it can provide a more complete picture of one’s
overall well-being and signiﬁcantly predict mortality and disability, even after controlling for many objective measures of health. In
CHARLS, respondents are asked to assess their own health on a
ﬁve-point scale: very good, good, fair, poor, and very poor. We then
condense these responses into a binary variable: bad health
(=1, poor and very poor) and good health (=0, very good, good and
fair).2
Self-reported health may suffer from misreporting bias.
Differences in individuals’ personal traits and threshold points

2
Unlike previous studies on China (Yip et al., 2007; Meng and Chen, 2014), we
code “fair” as good health. In the Chinese context, “fair” is a conservative expression
of “just so-so” or “ok”. So when a person rates his/her health as “fair”, it by no means
implies his/her health is bad.

may cause measurement errors. More optimistic individuals may
systematically overstate their health, or vice versa. To address the
potential misreporting bias, we use two other objective indicators
to measure individuals’ physical and mental health: the Limitations in Activities of Daily Living (ADL) Index and the Center of
Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale, respectively.
In contrast to self-reported health, ADL indicators are considered to be more objective and less likely to be affected by
differences in individual response scales (Bratti and Mendola,
2014). In particular, ADL indicators have the advantage of recording
speciﬁc facts related to an individual’s daily living rather than his/
her opinions on his/her physical well-being. In CHARLS, respondents are asked nine questions on ADL.3 For each question, there are
three choices: “No, I don’t have any difﬁculty” (=0); “I have difﬁculty”
(=1), and “I cannot do it” (=2).4 We sum these nine items and create
an ADL index according to the following formula proposed by
Gertler and Gruber (2002):


score  Minscore
ADL ¼
Maxscore  Minscore
The ADL index ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating
more limitations in activities of daily living and worse physical
health.

3
ADL measures difﬁculties in the following nine activities: running or jogging
approximately 1 km; walking 1 km; walking 100 m; getting up from a chair after
sitting for a long period; climbing several ﬂights of stairs without resting; stooping/
kneeling/crouching; reaching or extending your arms above shoulder level; lifting
or carrying weights over 10 jin (=0.5 kg); and picking up a small coin from a table.
4
It should be noted that in wave 2012 there are four choices for the ADL question:
“No, I don’t have any difﬁculty”; “I have difﬁculty but can still do it”; “Yes, I have
difﬁculty and need help”; and “I cannot do it”. To be consistent with wave 2008, we
recode “I have difﬁculty but can still do it” and “Yes, I have difﬁculty and need help”
into one scale: “I have difﬁculty”.

CES-D was originally developed by Radloff (1977) and is widely
used as a measure of mental health. Respondents are asked to
indicate the frequency of experiencing ten feelings or emotions
during the past week.5 The four responses are “rarely or none of the
time” (=0); “some or a little of the time” (=1); “occasionally or a
moderate amount of the time” (=2); and “most or all of the time” (=3).
The responses to questions about feeling hopeful about the future
and being happy are reversely recoded such that higher values of
the CES-D scale represent more depressive symptoms and worse
mental health. Following Duncan and Rees (2005), we sum the
responses to the ten questions to produce a scale between 0 and 30.
Moreover, because the CES-D scale is heavily skewed to the right,
we use the log-transformed CES-D scale as the dependent variable
in the following regressions.6
3.2.2. Measuring social capital
Social capital is measured using the CHARLS social participation
question: “Have you done any of these activities in the last month?”
There are ten activities from which the respondents can choose.7
We exclude two activities (“stock investment” and “using the
Internet”) because they are not participatory in nature. For the

5
The ten items are as follows: I was bothered by things that don’t usually bother
me; I had trouble keeping my mind on what I was doing; I felt depressed; I felt
everything I did was an effort; I felt hopeful about the future; I felt fearful; My sleep
was restless; I was happy; I felt lonely; and I could not get “going”.
6
The skewness value of the CES-D scale is 0.934.
7
The ten activities are as follows: volunteering or philanthropy activities; taking
care of the elderly or disabled that you don’t live with free of charge; offering help to
relatives, friends or neighbors that you don’t live with free of charge; going to school
or attending training courses; visiting friends; playing mahjoon, chess, poker and
going to a community activity center; participating in tai chi, dancing and other
group activities; participating in activities organized by community organizations;
investing in stocks and using the Internet.

remaining eight activities, if the respondents answer “yes”, the
index is coded as 1 and 0 otherwise. We then standardize the total
score from these eight questions and construct the social capital
index.
3.2.3. Other control variables
We also control for individual-, household-, and communitylevel variables. Individual-level variables are age, gender, area of
residence, education, marital status, insurance status, and health
behaviors. Household-level variables are family size, log of per
capita income, availability of water, and whether the house is
connected to sewage. Community-level variables are community
social capital, hospital density, and activity center density.8 The
deﬁnitions of all variables are presented in Table 1.
3.3. Descriptive statistics
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for all variables. The
results show that 28.9% of the total sample report bad health. The
average values of the ADL index and the CES-D scale are 0.145 and
8.023, respectively. The mean social capital index is 0.081,
suggesting a relatively low level of social capital among Chinese
older adults. In the sub-sample statistics, females on average are
more likely to report bad health, a higher ADL index (worse
physical health) and a higher CES-D scale (worse mental health)
than males. Females tend to have lower social capital than
males. Compared with younger-old adults (aged 45 to below 60),
older-old adults (aged 60 or above) have worse general health, a
higher ADL index, a higher CES-D scale, and lower social capital.
Furthermore, urban older adults are more likely to report better
health and have higher social capital than their rural counterparts.
In terms of other explanatory variables, females tend to have lower
levels of education and fewer unhealthy behaviors than males.
Older-old adults have lower levels of education and income than
younger-old adults. We also note that urban older adults enjoy

In line with the current literature, we calculate community social capital by
averaging individual social capital index at the community level.

We ﬁrst pool the observations from the 2008 and 2012 waves of
the CHARLS and estimate the following standard Pooled Ordinary
Least Squares (POLS) model:
Hit ¼ a þ bSCit þ X it d þ Di þ Dt þ eit

ð1Þ

where Hit measures health outcomes of individual i in year t. SCit
denotes the social capital index of individual i at year t; X it a vector
of individual-, household-, and community-level variables that are
either time-variant or time-invariant; Di a province dummy; Dt a
year dummy; and eit the error term. b is the coefﬁcient of interest.
The POLS estimate of b is inconsistent if social capital SCit is
correlated with the error term eit . As previously discussed,
endogeneity may arise from several sources. Omitted variables,
such as time preference and personal traits, may affect both social
capital and health. In addition, reverse causality may be a concern
because healthier people are more likely to participate in social
activities and have higher social capital.
To address bias caused by time-invariant unobservables, we
estimate a model with individual ﬁxed effects as follows:
Hit ¼ a þ bSCit þ K it d þ Dt þ ai þ mit

ð2Þ

where Hit denotes health outcomes; SCit the individual social
capital index; K it a vector of time-varying individual-, household-,
and community variables; Dt a year dummy; ai an individual ﬁxed
effect; and mit the error term.
Although FE estimation can correct for the bias caused by timeinvariant unobservables, the biases derived from time-variant
unobservables and reverse causality are still a concern. One
common solution to this problem is the IV approach. A proper IV
identiﬁcation strategy requires the instrument to be correlated
with the endogenous social capital variable (relevance condition)
and at the same time not have a direct, independent effect on
individual health (exclusion restriction condition). The ﬁrst stage
can be formularized as follows:
SCi ¼ a þ X i g þ ’Z i þ ni

ð3Þ

In the second stage, we use the predicted value of social capital
in an equation similar to Eq. (1). The credibility of the IV approach
depends on the validity of instrumental variable Z i , which is
excluded in the second stage.
Our IV is whether a respondent’s surname belongs to the
common surnames in the village.9 In CHARLS, village leaders are
asked whether the village has common surnames, and if they
answer “yes,” they are further asked to list the three most common
surnames.10 We combine the information on the respondent’s
surname and the three most common surnames in the village to
construct the IV. If a respondent’s surname belongs to one of the
three most common surnames in the village, the IV is denoted as
1 and 0 otherwise. The surname of a female respondent is coded
the same as her husband’s because they tend to share the same
social and family networks. Because having common surnames is
only a phenomenon in rural villages, this question is only asked for
rural respondents. In addition, for reasons of data conﬁdentiality,

9
In rural China, although households with the same surname belong to the same
ancestry, they live independently under different roofs in the village. For
households with many sons, when the sons become adults and get married, they
usually move out and form a new household within the village.
10
The criterion for a common surname is that the percentage of local persons who
have the same surname is above 20%.

we only have access to the rural samples of wave 2008 for the IV
analysis.11 Therefore, the IV results represent a local average
treatment effect and are a complement to FE estimation.
The validity of the relevance condition of our IV rests on the
hypothesis that having a common surname is correlated with a
higher social capital index. Surnames in China are usually based on
the same lineage identity and act as “glue” to hold family members
together. A common surname usually embodies strong trust and
solidarity among its members. The surname could provide more
opportunities for rural residents to communicate with each other
and participate more in community affairs (Lei et al., 2014).
Therefore, if a respondent has a common surname, we can
naturally hypothesize that he/she could have higher social capital
than those who do not.
However, if the common surname is endogenous to health, the
exclusion restriction condition will fail and estimation bias will
ensue. There are three arguments regarding why we expect our
instrument to satisfy the exclusion restriction condition. First, the
surnames in China have been stable and well preserved through
the male lineage for generations due to the prevalence of Confucian
culture, in which people do not change their surnames (Du et al.,
1992). No surname or lineage has an inherent superiority or
inferiority (Baker, 1979). Second, the composition of surnames in
rural villages is relatively stable because the household mobility is
restricted by the household registration (hukou) system.12 Rural
residents are tied to the land where they were born and unlikely to
move between different places (Pan, 2011). For the older adults in
the rural village in particular, the cultural tradition of “fallen leaves
return to root (Luo Ye Gui Gen)” makes them even more reluctant to

move out of their home villages. Therefore, the composition of
surnames in a village is a pre-determined condition rather than a
result of personal choices.13 Third, a self-selection effect exists in
marriage markets. For example, if males with common surnames
have higher social status, it is more likely for them to get married
with “healthy” females, which will lead to an upward bias of our
estimates. We argue that the self-selection effect in marriage
markets tends to diminish because the mean marriage age of older
adults in our sample is 22.44, whereas the mean value of their
current age is 60.57.
To further assess whether our instrument is as good as random,
we tested for differences in characteristics among respondents
(Table 3). The comparison of average characteristics between
individuals with or without common surnames (CS) does not
suggest any consistent differences. An exception is the percentage
of secondary education, which is signiﬁcantly (at the 10% level)
lower in individuals with common surnames than in individuals
without common surnames. The difference is, however, only 0.039,
thus economically not very signiﬁcant. Moreover, we control for
education in our regressions. At the bottom of Table 3, there are
two other signiﬁcantly different community variables: hospital
and activity center. However, the hospital and activity center do
not explain health effects because the variables are insigniﬁcant
throughout our main regression results reported below. For other
community-level variables, two-sided t-tests do not reveal any
signiﬁcant, systematic differences.
One of our dependent variables (bad health) is expressed as a
binary value, either 1 (bad health) or 0 (good health). The use of a two
stage least squares (2SLS) model that works with continuous
dependent variables will yield inconsistent results. It has been
suggested that the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) approach is
best suited for IV estimation with a non-linear second-stage
regression (Blundell and Powell, 2004; Terza et al., 2008).
Bhattacharya et al. (2006) show that in a test on simulated data
for binary outcome variables, the 2SLS estimator exhibits greater bias
than the 2SRI estimator. Based on the Health and Retirement data in
the US, Basu and Coe (2015) also observe that, compared with the
2SRI estimator, the 2SLS estimator produces substantially different
and potentially biased results for binary outcome variables.
Therefore, we believe the 2SRI estimator to be a better choice for
the analysis of the “bad health” model. For the other two continuous
outcome variables (the ADL index and the CES-D scale), we will still
use the 2SLS estimator. The main difference between 2SRI and 2SLS is
that in 2SRI, the actual endogenous variable (rather than the
predicted value of the endogenous variable) and the residuals from
the ﬁrst-stage estimation are included as additional regressors in the
second-stage equation. Because residuals are correlated with the
unobservable characteristics that affect both the endogenous
variable (social capital) and the dependent variable in the secondstage regression (bad health), their inclusion ensures that the social
capital coefﬁcient in the second-stage regression only reﬂects the
causal effect of social capital on health.

The sample size was further reduced after deleting the observations with
missing values. Nonetheless, the mean value of the variables in the IV sample
(Table 3) and the rural sample (Table 2) is very similar, indicating that the missing
value is random in the IV sample.
12
It should be noted that the hukou system has been partially relaxed in recent
years. Many rural surplus young laborers go to cities to ﬁnd jobs, but the rural older
adults are unlikely to perform these jobs in cities because of their old age. Moreover,
for the rural young labors working in the city, it is extremely difﬁcult for them to get
the urban hukou and settle in the city. Therefore, the number of registered people in
rural village remains relatively unchanged.

5.1.1. OLS regressions
Table 4 reports the OLS estimates of the effect of social capital
on three health measures. Controlling for all observable variables,

13
More importantly, villages in rural China were established administratively and
arbitrarily in 1949 to meet the needs of collective farming rather than because of the
blood connections among people (Pan, 2011). Thus, there is no self-selection effect
in the surname composition of the village.

the year dummy and province dummy, social capital is signiﬁcantly
associated with health. A one standard-deviation increase in
social capital is associated with a 0.23 standard-deviation decrease
in reporting bad health, a 0.142 standard-deviation decrease in the
ADL index and a 0.295 standard-deviation decrease in the
CES-D scale.14 However, we must cautiously interpret this
association as the inability of OLS to control for the possible
unobserved heterogeneity and reverse causality bias. Next, we use

14
We also estimate the untransformed ADL and CES-D using Poisson regression
(which takes into account that untransformed ADL and CES-D can only be zero or a
positive number) as a sensitivity check and ﬁnd that our conclusions remain
unaffected. The results are available upon request.

5.1.2. Individual ﬁxed effects
Table 5 presents the individual FE estimation. We start with a
parsimonious model in which we only examine the impact of social
capital on health. Then, we add a set of control variables. Our
results show that social capital has a signiﬁcant effect on having
bad health and the ADL index. A one standard-deviation increase in
social capital is associated with a 0.186 standard-deviation
decrease in reporting bad health and a 0.075 standard-deviation
decrease in the ADL index. However, there appears to be no effect
of social capital on the CES-D scale. There are two possible
explanations. First, the relationship between social capital and the
CES-D scale may be driven by a common, time-invariant
unobserved heterogeneity such as personal traits. More optimistic
and extroverted people are more likely to participate in social
activities and at the same time less likely to have depressive
feelings. Second, participation in volunteer organizations in China
could often be simply a practice in which the “young old” take care
of the “very old” (Norstrand and Xu, 2012), which is likely to reduce
the beneﬁcial effects of social capital on mental health.
5.1.3. Instrumental variable
Table 6 reports the results of IV estimates. As expected, the
ﬁrst-stage results show that having a common surname increases
respondents’ social capital index by 0.013 percentage points, which
is statistically signiﬁcant at the 5% level. The under-identiﬁcation
test (Anderson canon. corr. LM statistic) rejects the null hypothesis
that the IV is under-identiﬁed. Thus, our instrument is a signiﬁcant
predictor of respondents’ social capital.
The second-stage results indicate that social capital has a
signiﬁcant effect on general and physical health but not on mental
health. A one standard-deviation increase in social capital leads to
a 4.863 standard-deviation decrease in reporting bad health and a
2.226 standard-deviation decrease in physical activity limitations.
It is interesting to note that the coefﬁcients on the social capital are
larger in the IV regressions than in the OLS and FE estimates,
suggesting that OLS and FE estimates may underestimate the effect
of social capital on health. Suppose that those individuals who are
healthy are also more likely to participate in social activities; this
situation would cause an upward bias (in absolute value) in the
estimated coefﬁcients of social capital. An alternative argument is
that, because investment in social capital is driven in part by the
opportunity cost of time (Glaeser et al., 2002; Putnam, 2000),
individuals with relatively worse health have a greater incentive to
participate in social activities because their opportunity cost of
time is lower. This would imply a downward bias of the coefﬁcients
of social capital. The patterns of the coefﬁcients in our IV
estimation appear to support the latter interpretation.
One of the most common concerns about the IV analysis is the
weak instrument problem. The Cragg-Donald Wald F-statistics in
our regression is 4.268, much lower than the critical value of 10
proposed by Stock et al. (2002).15 The weak instrument indicates
that the standard test statistics used for inference may be
unreliable and point estimates can be imprecise. To dispel this
concern, we use the conditional likelihood ratio (CLR) test to
ascertain whether our instrument is weak. The CLR test is proposed
by Moreira (2003), Mikusheva and Poi (2006) and Moreira (2009),
which has a correct coverage probability in conﬁdence regions
under weak instruments. If the CLR test has ﬁnite conﬁdence
intervals, our data contain sufﬁcient information on the social

15
It is noteworthy that the low value of the F-statistics might simply be a small
sample problem, i.e., in a larger sample the F-statistic might look more convincing.

capital effect. Otherwise, if the CLR test has an inﬁnite interval, i.e.,
two intervals (1, x1) and (x2, +1), where x1 < x1 or a single
interval (1, +1), there is a weak instrument problem. The CLR
test shows that the effects of social capital on the ADL index and
the CES-D scale have ﬁnite conﬁdence intervals.16 Furthermore,
because our model has one endogenous variable and one IV, it is a
just-identiﬁed model. According to Angrist and Pischke (2009, p.
209), “even with weak instruments, just-identiﬁed 2SLS is
approximately centered where it should be. We therefore say

that just-identiﬁed 2SLS is median-unbiased.” Thus, we argue that
our IV estimates are reliable despite the low Wald F-statistics.

reasons. First, compared with the IV model, the ﬁxed effects model represents lower
bound estimates. Second, the sample size of IV analysis is small and may suffer from
low explanatory power.

the potential measurement error. If individuals misreport their
social activities in a systematic manner, our estimations would be
biased. For example, an individual with cognitive impairment and
bad health may have difﬁculties in recalling past events and thus
may underreport social activities. Our estimations would therefore
be biased downward. To test for measurement error, we recode the
social capital index into a dummy variable. If an individual
participated in one of the eight activities in the past month, the
social capital index is recoded as 1 and 0 otherwise. In this manner,
we can signiﬁcantly reduce the likelihood of misreporting errors
and check the robustness of the FE estimates. Table 7 presents the
results with a dichotomous indicator of social capital. Compared
with those shown in Table 5, the effects of social capital on bad

health and the ADL index are slightly reduced but still statistically
signiﬁcant. Therefore, our main ﬁndings that social capital has a
positive effect on general and physical health remain intact.
Additionally, as noted in previous sections, one source of
endogeneity unaddressed by the FE model might be derived from
the unobservable, time-varying shocks that may simultaneously
affect both social capital and health. These shocks can occur at the
individual, family, and community levels. For individuals, the
shocks might be serious accidents that cause a reduction in social
capital and deterioration of health. For families, they might be
serious accidents to other family members, which may crowd out
respondents’ time for social participation and incur a negative
impact on their own health. For communities, they might be

natural disasters that may affect respondents’ social participation
and health simultaneously.18
To avoid these confounding cases, we checked the sensitivity of
our estimates by adding the individual, family, and communitylevel shocks into our empirical speciﬁcations. If time-varying
unobservable shocks represent the main cause for the correlation

18
Regarding the relationship between social capital and natural disasters, Toya
and Skidmore (2014) and Yamamura (2015) observe that natural disasters help
social capital formation. However, according to Aida et al. (2013), natural disasters
destroy not only physical environments but social networks and relationships in
communities as well. Thus, they have a negative effect on social capital. Our data
show that natural disasters and social participation are negatively correlated
(0.097, p = 0.000), suggesting that they tend to have a negative effect on social
capital among older adults in China.

between social capital and health, we would expect the social
capital coefﬁcients to decline signiﬁcantly after including those
exogenous shocks. We use the detailed information on individual
and community-level shocks in CHARLS and carry out separate
estimations on shocks at each level.19 Table 8 presents the separate
estimations with the inclusion of these time-varying shocks. The
magnitude of the coefﬁcients of social capital remains relatively
unchanged and statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting time-varying,

CHARLS collects individual- and family-level shock information by asking “Have
you ever been in a trafﬁc accident or any other kind of major accidental injury and
received medical treatment?” If respondents answer “yes”, we recode it as 1 and
0 otherwise. For community-level shock information, it asks “Has your village/
community experienced serious natural disasters in the past ﬁve years?” If village
heads answer “yes”, we recode it as 1 and 0 otherwise.

unobserved heterogeneity should not pose considerable threat to
our FE results.
5.3. Heterogeneity by gender, age, and area of residence
To explore whether social capital has differential effects by
gender, age, and area of residence, we incorporate the
interaction terms into the FE model. Table 9 shows that none
of gender differences were statistically signiﬁcant when tested
in a fully interacted model. This ﬁnding is in contrast to results
reported in the literature on gender differences in other
countries, which indicate that women tend to derive fewer
health beneﬁts from social capital compared to men (e.g., Berry
and Welsh, 2010; Ferlander and Mäkinen, 2009). One of the
arguments for gender differences is that women usually play a
supportive and subordinate role in social interactions, which
may decrease their sense of control and enhance feelings of
being burdened and emotional stress. However, some studies
report that with increased marketization and economic
development in China, the role of women and men in society
is becoming equally divided (Yu and Xie, 2012; Matthews and
Nee, 2000). This may explain why we detect no differential
effect by gender on health.
Table 9 also reveals that the effect of social capital on the ADL
index is signiﬁcantly stronger for older-old adults. The negative
sign of the interaction term indicates that social capital leads to a
greater decrease in the ADL index (thus better physical health) for
older-old adults than for younger-old adults. This ﬁnding is
consistent with the results of Muckenhuber et al. (2013), who also
note that social capital affects the health of older people more
strongly than that of younger people. One possible explanation is

that, compared with younger-old adults, older-old adults lack
better coping and compensatory opportunities to make up for their
lower social capital. Thus, social capital plays a greater role in
health production for older-old adults.
Our estimates further show that the effect of social capital on
health is not heterogeneous across area of residence. This ﬁnding
stands in contrast to an earlier study on China (Norstrand and Xu,
2012) that indicates that urban people beneﬁt more from social
capital than rural people do. The authors argue that limited
resources in rural areas make it difﬁcult for rural people to access
certain material resources that are essential to their health.
Therefore, rural people might not be able to beneﬁt as much from
their family members, friends, and people around them because
they are also resource constrained. However, our results are not
surprising because China has initiated a new round of health care
reform in recent years, which has invested heavily in health care
infrastructure in rural areas and hence narrowed the resources
distribution gap between urban and rural areas. This narrowing
gap could have ameliorated the contributing role of social capital in
the urban-rural health divide.
6. Conclusion
Employing detailed longitudinal data from the China Health
and Retirement Survey, this paper examines the causal effect of
structural social capital on health among Chinese older adults.
Although many studies have shown the positive relationship
between social capital and health, this is the ﬁrst longitudinal
study using FE and IV estimations to examine their potential causal
relationship in a nationally representative Chinese population
setting. Additionally, our study contributes to the literature by

exploring the heterogeneous effects of social capital on health by
gender, age, and area of residence.
We obtain evidence indicating that structural social capital has
a signiﬁcant and positive effect on general and physical health but
not on mental health. Our estimates pass a series of robustness
checks. We also ﬁnd evidence of the heterogeneous effects of social
capital on health. Our results indicate that the social capital effect
on physical health tends to be stronger for older-old adults.
However, we ﬁnd no differential effects by gender or area of
residence.
A central message gathered from our study is that,
confronted with health challenges caused by population aging,
social capital does serve as a key instrument for health
promotion among older adults in China. The implication of
our study is that government can improve the health of the
older population by investing in social capital. This can be
achieved through the following approaches. First, government
can directly provide funding or subsidies to promote individuals’ social capital formation, for example, organizing community
events to facilitate social interaction and community participation. Second, government can create favorable policies for the
establishment of a variety of voluntary organizations and
community groups to stimulate community participation and
develop individuals’ social capital. Third, government should
pay attention to the heterogeneous effects of social capital on
health. More efforts must be exerted in strengthening social
capital formation for younger–older adults.
Our study is subject to several limitations. First, we focus only
on the structural component of social capital. Social capital is
multi-dimensional; therefore our measurement is not comprehensive and cannot reﬂect the complex relationship between
social capital and health. Future research can explore the complex
relationship between different forms of social capital and different
health outcomes. Second, the subjects in our dataset are limited to

urban and rural residents aged 45 or older, and our IV analysis is
restricted to rural samples. Thus, our conclusion cannot be
generalized to the entire population. Third, our study only
empirically examines the causal relationship between social
capital and health. The mechanisms underlying this relationship
were not explored. We leave them for future research.
