Food and housing insecurity may contribute to poorer mental and physical health. It is unclear as to
whether those with prior military service, compared to those without, are more vulnerable to these
current stressors. The objective of this study was to use U.S. population-based data to determine whether
prior military service moderates the association of food and housing insecurity with poor mental and
physical health.
We analyzed data from nine states administering the Social Context module from the 2011 and 2012
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the associations of housing and food insecurity with poor mental and physical health and potential modiﬁcation by
military service. Compared with those with a history of military service, those without had higher prevalence
of food insecurity (23.1% versus 13.7%) and housing insecurity (36.0% versus 22.5%). Food insecurity was
associated with poor mental and physical health (mental health: odds ratio (OR)¼3.47, 95% conﬁdence interval
(CI)¼[3.18–3.77]; physical health: OR¼3.21, 95% CI¼[2.92–3.53]). Similar associations were observed between
housing insecurity and poor mental and physical health. Prior military service was signiﬁcantly associated with
poor physical health. Interaction terms of prior military service with food and housing were not statistically
signiﬁcant. Food and housing insecurity does not appear to differentially impact mental and physical health
among those with and without military service.

Introduction
Individuals with prior military experience are a unique population and may provide insights regarding the effects of social
stressors on vulnerability and resilience (King, King, Foy, Keane,
& Fairbank, 1999). Competing hypotheses exist as to whether this
population is psychologically and physically more vulnerable or
resilient to current stressors (Aldwin & Stokols, 1988; Elder &
Clipp, 1989). Many individuals may join the military to escape
dysfunctional and chaotic situations, suggesting that despite
exposure to early adversity, this population may have an increased
capacity for resilience (Blosnich, Dichter, Cerulli, Batten, & Bossarte, 2014; Katon et al., 2015). Nevertheless, compared with those
without military service, those with such a history consistently
report poorer physical and mental health (Hoerster et al., 2012;
Lehavot, Hoerster, Nelson, Jakupcak, & Simpson, 2012). Thus, it is
possible that early adverse experiences, coupled with militaryn

related trauma may increase vulnerability to long-term social
stressors (Aldwin, Levenson, & Spiro, 1994). Yet, it remains unclear
whether social stressors may differentially contribute to observed
health disparities among those with a history of military service.
Food and housing insecurity are two types of social stressors
that can have a profound impact on health (Braveman, Egerter,
& Williams, 2011; Commision on Social Determinants of Health
(CSDH), 2008; Ofﬁce of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion,
2015). In 2013, approximately 14% of U.S. households were food
insecure, deﬁned as having restricted access to safe and healthy
foods (Coleman-Jensen, Gergory, & Singh, 2014). Adverse living
conditions, such as crowded living and high housing cost to
income ratio, represent housing insecurity (Johnson & Meckstroth,
1998); In 2014, 40% of adults reported that mortgage or rent were
signiﬁcant sources of stress (American Psychological Association,
2015).
A growing body of evidence demonstrates the link between
food and housing insecurity and poor health behaviors and
healthcare access. For example, 43% of US adults reported that
they have eaten too much or have eaten unhealthy foods because

of stress (American Psychological Association, 2015). Twenty percent of US adults reported having or considered skipping an
annual doctor visit due to ﬁnancial concerns (American Psychological Association, 2015). Food and housing insecurity may also
contribute to unhealthy weight status among youth and adults
(Casey et al., 2006; Cutts et al., 2011; Pan, Sherry, Njai, & Blanck,
2012; Rose & Bodor, 2006), and are associated with increased
emergency room use, hospitalization, and poor mental health
(Heﬂin, Siefert, & Williams, 2005; Kushel, Gupta, Gee, & Haas,
2006; Whitaker, Phillips, & Orzol, 2006).
Identifying population segments more vulnerable to poor
health is crucial to direct funding for appropriate evidence-based
programs and services and to address existing health disparities.
Little knowledge exists as to whether social stressors differentially
impact the health of those with and without prior military service.
Therefore, the objective of this study was to use U.S. populationbased data to determine whether prior military service moderates
the association of food and housing insecurity with poor mental
and physical health.

the cutoff value of 4 6 days to indicate poor mental health (Bossarte, He, Claassen, Knox, & Tu, 2011) and 4 14 days to indicate
poor physical health (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
2000).
The two independent variables of interest were dichotomous
measures of housing and food insecurity. Housing insecurity was
based on responses to the question “How often in the past 12
months would you say you were worried or stressed about having
enough money to pay your rent/mortgage?” Food insecurity was
derived from the question “How often in the past 12 months
would you say you were worried or stressed about having enough
money to buy nutritious meals?” Response options included
“never,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” “usually,” and “always.” Consistent
with other studies (Liu, Njai, Greenlund, Chapman, & Croft, 2014;
Pan et al., 2012), we classiﬁed those as having food and housing
insecurity if their responses included “sometimes,” “usually,” or
“always.”
Demographics included sex, age (18–44, 45–65, and Z 65
years), race/ethnicity (Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black,
Hispanic, and other/mixed race), education (o12, 12, and 4 12
years), and current marital/partnership status.

Methods
Data were derived from respondents in nine states (Hawaii,
Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, North
Carolina, Oklahoma, and Wyoming) administering the Social
Context module as part of the 2011 or 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS). BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional
telephone survey coordinated between state health departments
and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 2013c). BRFSS is administered via
random-digit dialing of landline and cell phones of noninstitutionalized adults agedZ18 years using a cluster stratiﬁed random sampling design. Details on methodology used in
the collection of BRFSS data have been previously documented
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013c). State-level
BRFSS datasets were appended after accounting for each state's
independent sampling methodology. Response rates for the four
states in 2011 ranged from 43.1% to 60.9% and for the seven states
in 2012 ranged from 38.0% to 47.8% (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 2013a, 2013b). The analytic sample included
81,405 (71.4%) of 113,983 respondents to the Social Context
module, after excluding those with missing (i.e., ‘not applicable,’
‘refused,’ and ‘don’t know/not sure’ responses) responses to
questions about military service status (n ¼184), food insecurity
(n ¼22,009), housing insecurity (n ¼29,929), mental health
(n ¼1937), and physical health (n ¼2445). To assess the potential
non-respondent bias to the independent variables, we compared
those with and without missing values on the independent
variables.
Measures
Prior military service status (yes/no) was obtained from selfreported responses to the question “Have you ever served on
active duty in the United States Armed Forces, either in the regular
military or in a National Guard or military reserve unit?”
Dependent variables were measures of poor mental and physical health. The mental health measure was derived from the
question “Now thinking about your mental health, which includes
stress, depression, and problems with emotions, for how many
days during the past 30 days was your mental health not good?”
The physical health measure was derived from the survey question
“Now thinking about your physical health, which includes physical
illness and injury, for how many days during the past 30 days was
your physical health not good?” Based on prior literature, we used

service. Second, we generated the weighted prevalence of poor
physical and mental health by the selected demographic characteristics and reported food or housing insecurity. The Wald
signiﬁcance test was used to determine signiﬁcant differences by
each characteristic. Last, we used multivariable logistic regression
with military service status as a moderator (military status  food
insecurity; military status  housing insecurity) using the Wald
signiﬁcance test to determine statistically signiﬁcant interaction.
All signiﬁcance levels are denoted at Po .05. Multiple imputation
was used to impute missing data on the covariates, all of which
had less than 1% missing in the ﬁnal analytic sample (Little &
Rubin, 2014). All reported results, other than observed Ns, are from
the multiple imputation. We used StataCorp Statistical Software
version 13 for all of the analyses (StataCorp, 2013).

Results
Among the analytic sample, 71,290 reported no prior military
service and 10,115 reported some prior military service. The distribution of demographic characteristics by prior military service is
presented in Table 1. Compared to those with prior military

service, a greater percentage of those without prior military
experience had food insecurity (23.1% versus 13.7%) and housing
insecurity (36.0% versus 22.5%). A greater percentage of those
without prior military service reported poor mental health (16.9%
versus 12.6%) whereas a greater percentage of those with prior
military service reported poor physical health (19.9% versus 16.1%).
Table 2 indicates the sample prevalence of poor mental health
and poor physical health by demographic characteristics. Poor
mental health was most common among those who were female
(P o.001), younger and middle-aged (Po .001), of racial/ethnic
minority status (P ¼.005), had less years of education (P o.001),
had no prior military service (P o.001), reported food and housing
insecurity (P o.001), and had poor physical health (P o.001). Poor
physical health was most common among those who were female
(P o.001), older aged (Po .001), had less years of education
(P o.001), had prior military service (P o.001), reported food
and housing insecurity (Po .001), and had poor mental health
(P o.001).

are cross-sectional. Thus, the ability to establish causality is not
possible. All data are self-reported and thereby prone to misclassiﬁcation bias, which may lead to greater error in estimated
odds ratios and respective conﬁdence intervals. Finally, limitations
in variables available in BRFSS did not allow for more detailed
analyses disentangling environmental and social factors underlying veteran status.
To conclude, our study adds to current literature by identifying
a robust relationship between measures of food and housing
insecurity and poor mental and physical health. We further
examined whether these relationships differed by prior military
service status and did not identify signiﬁcant differences. Future
research aimed at clarifying stress-health mechanisms and
potential vulnerability and protective factors are warranted.
Results from this study can help inform social service policy
makers about the added value of and need for a robust safety net
for economically at-risk populations. Minimizing current economic insecurities may help save the public from present and
future costs associated with poor mental and physical health.

Discussion

Appendix A. Supporting information

Our study shows that both food and housing insecurity are
associated with poor mental and physical health regardless of
prior service in the U.S. military. These ﬁndings support other
similar ﬁnding demonstrating associations of food and housing
insecurity with frequent mental distress (Liu et al., 2014). Our
analyses indicated that prior military service was only associated
with poor physical health. However, food and housing insecurity
did not appear to differentially impact mental or physical health of
those with military service.
Prior research has suggested that those with military service
may have increased vulnerability or resilience to social stressors
relative to civilians (Aldwin & Stokols, 1988; Elder & Clipp, 1989).
These theories are not supported by our failure to detect an
interaction between military service and food and housing insecurity. However, it is possible that any differential impact of food
and housing insecurity on physical and mental health may be
attenuated as a result of current programs and policies. Many of
those with military service may have increased access to resources
that may mitigate the health impacts of food and housing insecurity. For example, 42% of all veterans in the U.S. were enrolled in
the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) (2014), which provides
access to subsidized health care whereas civilians have experienced an estimated 80% rise in health insurance premiums since
2003 (Kaiser/HRET, 2013; U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,
2014).
The advantage of the BRFSS data is the large population-based
sample, which can allow for more precise population-level comparisons. That said, we acknowledge some inherent limitations in
this analysis. We cannot generalize our ﬁndings to the entire
country as our data are derived from states that selected to
administer the social context module. Further data for this analysis
