Background: Women are a rapidly growing segment of patients who seek care in the Veterans Affairs (VA) Healthcare
System, yet many questions regarding their health care experiences and outcomes remain unanswered. Racial and
ethnic disparities have been well-documented in the general population and among veterans; however, prior disparities
research conducted in the VA focused primarily on male veterans. We sought to characterize the ﬁndings and gaps in
the literature on racial and ethnic disparities among women using the VA.
Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature on racial and ethnic health care disparities exclusively among
women using the VA Healthcare System. We included studies that examined health care use, satisfaction, and/or quality,
and stratiﬁed data by race or ethnicity.
Results: Nine studies of the 2,591 searched met our inclusion criteria. The included studies examined contraception
provision/access (n ¼ 3), treatment of low bone mass (n ¼ 1), hormone therapy (n ¼ 1), use of mental health or
substance abuse–related services (n ¼ 2), trauma exposure and use of various services (n ¼ 1), and satisfaction with
primary care (n ¼ 1). Five of nine studies showed evidence of a signiﬁcant racial or ethnic difference.
Conclusion: In contrast with the wealth of literature examining disparities both among the male veterans and women in nonVA settings, only nine studies examine racial and ethnic disparities speciﬁcally among women in the VA Healthcare System.
These results demonstrate that there is an unmet need to further assess health care disparities among female VA users.

health care in the VA has doubled since 2000 (Frayne et al., 2014).
This growth has outpaced that of the male veteran population.
More than one-half of women veterans returning from the
conﬂicts in Iraq and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom,
Operation Iraqi Freedom, and Operation New Dawn) have
received VA health care (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs,
2012). However, most research conducted within the VA has
not included women participants, and many questions regarding
woman veterans’ health care experiences and outcomes remain
unanswered.
Female VA users are a vulnerable population with unique
health care needs. Compared with civilian women and male VA

users, they have a higher prevalence of mental illness and
medical comorbidities (Frayne et al., 2014; Haskell et al., 2010;
Lehavot, Hoerster, Nelson, Jakupcak, & Simpson, 2012). Additionally, women veterans who use the VA are disproportionately
from racial and ethnic minority groups. Almost 40% of women
veterans who use VA services are from a racial or ethnic minority
group compared with 23% of male veterans who use the VA
(Frayne et al., 2014). Thus, an increased effort to understand the
current state of care for women veterans, across all racial and
ethnic groups, is imperative to guide future operations, policy,
and research efforts.
The burden of racial and ethnic disparities among veterans
within the VA Healthcare System has been previously systematically reviewed (Saha et al., 2008) and was recently updated in
an evidence brief (U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Health
Services Research & Development, 2015). The majority of
studies included in the review showed that signiﬁcant racial or
ethnic disparities exist, and that these disparities existed across a
range of clinical areas including arthritis/pain management,
cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, human immunodeﬁciency virus, hepatitis C, mental health/substance abuse,
preventative/ambulatory care, rehabilitation, and palliative care.
However, the vast majority of the 171 studies included in the
initial VA systematic review included either no women or a very
small number (5% of total study participants) of women, and
none of the clinical content areas presented in the review were
areas speciﬁc to women’s health (such as cervical cancer
screening or contraception).
We systematically reviewed the literature on racial and ethnic
disparities in health care among women who receive care in the
VA Healthcare System. Although we report on any signiﬁcant
difference in health care by race or ethnicity, we recognize that
differences may not always indicate a disparity. The term “health
disparity” has been deﬁned as “a particular type of health difference that is closely linked with social or economic disadvantage” (Secretary’s Advisory Committee on National Health
Promotion and Disease Prevention Objective for 2020, 2008)
and, as such, implies an injustice. Because it is common practice
in the ﬁeld of disparities research to begin with the identiﬁcation
of differences between vulnerable and less vulnerable populations, with further inquiry to determine if differences represent inequitable or lower quality care for the vulnerable
population, we simply report on observed differences in this
report and use the terms “disparity” and “difference” somewhat
interchangeably. Our primary aims were to identify and summarize existing work in this area and to elucidate areas in which
future research efforts should be focused to ultimately work
toward the goal of reducing racial and ethnic disparities among
women veterans.
Methods
Search Strategy
A formalized protocol was written prior to initiation of the
systematic review. A health sciences librarian (C.W.) developed,
revised, translated, and performed literature searches in PubMed
(1946–present), EMBASE (1974–present), and the American
Psychological Association’s PsycINFO (1967–present). We constructed searches using the command language of each database
and the applicable search ﬁelds (Appendix 1). MeSH, EMTREE,
and American Psychological Association’s Thesaurus of Psychological Index Terms vocabulary were used. For this search, health

disparities and racial and ethnic population group search terms
were considered synonymous concepts and were combined
together with a Boolean operator “OR.” These synonymous
concepts were combined with a Boolean operator “AND” to the
veteran/VA and women search terms. No search limits were
applied and all languages were included. We ran all three database searches and citations were downloaded on June 30, 2014.
Study Selection
We removed duplicate citations and screened citations by
both title and abstract for relevance. We selected studies that
met the following criteria: 1) conducted solely within the VA
Healthcare System, 2) reported data on women exclusively or
stratiﬁed data by gender, 3) reported data on use, quality of
health care services, or satisfaction, 4) stratiﬁed results by patient race or ethnicity, 5) contained original data, and 6) published in a peer-reviewed journal. Two authors (A.C. and J.C.)
independently conﬁrmed study eligibility. Any discrepancies
were resolved through discussion and group consensus.
Data Abstraction
We abstracted data from all studies meeting inclusion criteria
using a structured form, which included study design, study
period, number enrolled, source of race/ethnicity data, race/
ethnicity of study population, source of outcome data, and outcomes. Studies were summarized in tables and classiﬁed according to clinical area. Because no standardized or validated
quality measures to evaluate cross sectional data exist, we were
unable to perform study quality and risk of bias scoring.
Furthermore, a meta-analysis was not performed given the
marked heterogeneity of both outcomes and outcome measures
used in the studies included in our systematic review.
Results
Search Yield
Our search located 1,622 citations in PubMED, 1,859 citations
in EMBASE, and 584 citations in PsychINFO. After duplicate citations were identiﬁed and removed, 2,591 citations were
screened by both title and abstract and 2,446 of these were
eliminated. The remaining 145 citations were reviewed in full
text, and 9 studies were identiﬁed for inclusion (Figure 1).
Description of Evidence
We identiﬁed nine studies that examine racial and ethnic
disparities in health care among women in the VA Healthcare
System (Table 1). Five studies were retrospective cohort studies
using VA administrative databases, two studies were crosssectional surveys, and two studies were combination cohort
and survey studies.
Overall, ﬁve of the nine studies showed evidence of a significant racial or ethnic difference in a quality of care or use of care
outcome (Table 2). Of the ﬁve studies that showed evidence of a
signiﬁcant racial or ethnic difference, one was a single VA study
and four used national VA data. The studies examined the
following health care domains: contraception provision/access,
treatment of low bone mass, hormone therapy, use of mental
health or substance abuse–related services, trauma exposure and
use of various VA services, and satisfaction with primary care.

Contraception provision/access (n ¼ 3)
Of the three retrospective cohort studies examining contraception provision/access, two found evidence of a signiﬁcant
racial or ethnic difference. One study of 805 woman veterans in
the San Diego VA Healthcare System who received a new prescription for hormonal contraception during the study period
found no racial or ethnic difference in hormonal contraception
adherence (deﬁned as obtaining 12 months of reﬁlls of hormonal
contraception in a 12-month time period; Kazerooni, Takizawa, &
Vu, 2014). Another study of all woman veterans in the national
VA system between age 18 and 45 who made at least one visit to
a VA primary care or women’s health clinic in ﬁscal year 2008
and had hormonal contraceptive coverage during the ﬁrst week
of the study period (n ¼ 6,946) found that Hispanic women were
signiﬁcantly more likely than White women to experience gaps
between reﬁlls of hormonal contraception, and that Hispanic
women and Black women received signiﬁcantly fewer overall
months of contraceptive coverage in a 12-month period than
White women (Borrero et al., 2013). A third study of all woman
veterans in the national VA system between age 18 and 45 who
made at least one visit to a VA primary care or women’s health
clinic ﬁscal year 2008 (n ¼ 103,950) found that Hispanic and
Black women were signiﬁcantly less likely than White women to
have documented receipt of any contraception (Borrero et al.,
2012). However, this same study found that, when Black
women were using a form of contraception, they were signiﬁcantly more likely than White women to use a highly effective
method of contraception (intrauterine device, implant, or surgical sterilization).

Treatment of low bone mass (n ¼ 1)
This cross-sectional survey study of 75 women who underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry testing at the Washington DC VA Medical Center found that Black women were
signiﬁcantly less likely than White women to receive an antiresorptive drug for treatment of low bone mass after controlling
for severity of low bone mass and prior fractures (Wei, Jackson, &
Herbers Jr, 2003).
Hormone therapy (n ¼ 1)
This retrospective cohort study of all woman veterans in the
national VA system using menopausal hormone therapy (MHT)
in 2001 (n ¼ 36,222) examined discontinuation of MHT after the
publication of the Women’s Health Initiative, which was the ﬁrst
major publication to describe risks of MHT (Rossouw et al.,
2002). They found that perimenopausal and postmenopausal
Black and Hispanic women were more likely than White women
to discontinue MHT (Haskell et al., 2008) by 2 years after the
Women’s Health Initiative publication.
Use of mental health or substance abuse–related services (n ¼ 2)
One combined survey and retrospective cohort study of 526
woman veterans at a primary care clinic at the Durham VA
Medical Center found no evidence of racial or ethnic difference in
use of mental health services in a 12-month period. However,
this study did ﬁnd that Black women reported wanting a mental
health referral more frequently than White women (34% vs. 27%;
p ¼ .01; Bosworth et al., 2000). The second retrospective cohort
study of 854 woman veterans in the national VA system

diagnosed with alcohol dependence found that Native American
women (n ¼ 22) were more likely than White women (n ¼ 532)

psychiatric symptoms, and VA services use among women veterans and reported no racial or ethnic difference in the use of
various VA services (including inpatient, emergency room,
women’s clinic, primary care, and mental health services) over a
12-month period (Grubaugh, Slagle, Long, Frueh, & Magruder,
2008).
Satisfaction with primary care (n ¼ 1)
A cross-sectional survey study of 1,447 women using VA
primary care or women’s health clinics in 5 states (Delaware,
Kentucky, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and West Virginia) asked
veterans about their satisfaction with primary care and found no
signiﬁcant racial or ethnic difference in overall rating of excellent
satisfaction, patient preference for maintaining a relationship
with her health care provider, patient perceptions of her provider’s interpersonal communication, accumulation of knowledge, or coordination of care (Bean-Mayberry, Chang, & Scholle,
2006).
Discussion
The results of our systematic review demonstrate that there
are only nine studies that examine racial and ethnic disparities
speciﬁcally among female VA users. Many clinical areas with
known racial and ethnic disparities among male VA users and
among women outside the VA have not been studied in female
VA users. Multiple groups and policymakers, including the VA,
have called for the identiﬁcation and eradication of racial and
ethnic disparities in health care to be a national priority (Fine &
Demakis, 2003; Institute of Medicine, 2003; Koh, Blakey, &
Roper, 2014; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
2011). The VA is an ideal place to examine racial and ethnic
differences among women for several reasons. The VA provides
care to a racially and ethnically diverse population, taking care
of 360,000 women veterans of whom 29% are Black, 1% are
Asian, 1% are Native American/Alaska Native, 1% are Native
Hawaiian/other Paciﬁc Islander, and 6% are of Hispanic origin
(Frayne et al., 2014). Many of the ﬁnancial confounders present
in the private sector, such as insurance coverage and ability to
pay for care, are removed in the VA setting. Furthermore,
administrative databases in the VA contain extensive national
data on quality and use. These factors make the VA an optimal
and uniquely informative place to identify and understand
racial and ethnic health care disparities. Thus, the relative
paucity of data on racial and ethnic disparities among woman
veterans is concerning.
A majority of studies included in our review showed evidence
of a racial or ethnic difference. The clinical area with the most
studies (n ¼ 3) was contraception. Of the three studies on
contraception, two showed a signiﬁcant racial or ethnic difference in adherence to or receipt of contraception and one showed

no difference. The study that showed no difference was based on
a much smaller sample (n ¼ 805; Kazerooni et al., 2014) than the
other two (n ¼ 6,946 and n ¼ 103,950; Borrero et al., 2012;
Borrero et al., 2013). The smaller study did show, however, a
nonsigniﬁcant trend toward lower adherence to contraception in
Black and Hispanic women and may have been simply underpowered to detect statistical signiﬁcance. Additionally, this study
was conducted in a single VA as opposed to the other two, which
were national VA samples, so the results of this study may reﬂect
factors speciﬁc to an individual VA Healthcare System. Overall,
these ﬁndings of racial and ethnic differences in adherence to
and receipt of contraception among women VA users aged 18 to
45 are broadly consistent with the observed racial and ethnic
differences in use of contraception and unintended pregnancy in
the general U.S. population of teens and women aged 15 to 44
(Dehlendorf et al., 2014; Finer & Zolna, 2014).
Racial and ethnic differences in patient satisfaction among
male veterans has been examined in at least ﬁve studies (Saha
et al., 2008), and three of these showed signiﬁcant racial or
ethnic disparities (Flaherty, Naidu, Lawton, & Pathak, 1981;
Ohldin et al., 2004; Young, Meterko, & Desai, 2000). Our systematic review revealed only one study on satisfaction among
women at the VA (Bean-Mayberry et al., 2006). This survey study
showed no racial or ethnic differences in satisfaction with primary care, which is encouraging. However, the response rate was
55%, and it is unclear if respondent characteristics were different
from those of nonresponders. Given that this is the only published study on racial or ethnic differences in satisfaction among
women at the VA, it is unclear if racial or ethnic satisfaction
differences exist in care received outside of primary care.
Although there are challenges with using patient satisfaction as
an outcome measure, such as variability in scales used and a high
degree of subjectivity, patient satisfaction studies may nonetheless be especially relevant given the increasing importance of
patient satisfaction measures in quality metrics.
Interestingly, some of the racial or ethnic differences we
found among women at the VA appear on the surface to favor
racial or ethnic minority groups. In particular, Black women were
found to use contraception belonging in the category of “most
effective” methods (intrauterine devices, implants, or surgical
sterilization) more often than White women (Borrero et al.,
2012). However, this difference is likely driven by higher rates
of surgical sterilization among African American women
(Borrero et al., 2010; Dehlendorf et al., 2014), who may have
higher rates of post-sterilization regret (Borrero et al., 2008). A
second difference that may seem to favor Blacks and Hispanics is
that perimenopasual and postmenopausal Black and Hispanic
women were more likely than White women to discontinue
hormone therapy (Haskell et al., 2008) by 2 years after the
Women’s Health Initiative publication, which was the ﬁrst
publication to emphasize the risks of MHT (Rossouw et al., 2002).
Again, the implication of this difference is unclear, because use of
hormone therapy is highly sensitive to patient preference and
because reasons for disparate discontinuation rates are unclear.
Finally, Native American women completed inpatient alcohol
treatment programs more often than White women (Ross et al.,
1998), perhaps owing to clinician awareness that Native Americans are disproportionately burdened by alcohol-related problems like binge drinking (Akins, Lanfear, Cline, & Mosher, 2013)
and alcohol-attributable mortality (Landen, Roeber, Naimi,
Nielsen, & Sewell, 2014). However, it may be difﬁcult to draw
signiﬁcant conclusions from this study given the small number
(n ¼ 22, 3% of study population) of Native American women.

A. Carter et al. / Women's Health Issues xxx-xx (2016) 1–9

Additional work is needed to understand the clinical signiﬁcance
of these ﬁndings.
Although the majority of the studies included in our review
evaluate gender-speciﬁc topics (contraception, low bone mass,
hormone therapy), the fact that there were only ﬁve studies on
these topics demonstrates the dearth of disparities literature in
the area of gender-speciﬁc health conditions among women veterans. Racial and ethnic disparities have been shown to exist in
non-VA settings in multiple gender-speciﬁc areas that have not yet
been examined within the VA, including cervical cancer screening,
mammography, prenatal care, and annual preventive visits (Kaiser
Family Foundation, 2009; National Healthcare Quality and
Disparities Report, 2011). In the non-VA setting, White and Hispanic women are less likely than Black and Asian women to
receive a mammogram, Asian women are less likely than White
women to receive a pap smear, and Native American women are
less likely to receive prenatal care during the ﬁrst trimester than
White women (National Healthcare Quality and Disparities
Report, 2011). Given that patients who receive care at the VA
have a higher burden of illness and lower income as compared
with the general population (Agha, Lofgren, VanRuiswyk, & Layde,
2000), ﬁndings from studies in the private sector may not be
generalizable to the VA population. Our ﬁndings of racial and
ethnic differences in contraception, hormone therapy, and low
bone mass woman veterans, however, do raise concerns about
health inequities for other gender-speciﬁc outcomes.
Additionally, there are many clinical areas in which racial or
ethnic disparities have been demonstrated among male veterans
in the VA system that have not yet been examined among
women VA users. In the prior systematic review (Saha et al.,
2008) that was recently updated in a policy brief (U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs Health Services Research &
Development, 2015), multiple studies have found racial or
ethnic disparities among men who use the VA in the clinical
areas of chronic pain, diabetes, and heart and vascular disease.
Additionally, in the prior reviews, disparities were very prevalent
in the use of surgery or invasive procedures. Thus, our search
parameters were deliberately broad to identify health disparities
of any kind. The fact that many of the studies that met our inclusion criteria were focused on gender-speciﬁc health conditions reﬂects the dearth of literature on disparities across the
range of medical diseases that occur in women veterans. This is
particularly concerning given that the most common health
conditions affecting women in the VA system in fact include
chronic pain, diabetes, and heart and vascular disease (Frayne
et al., 2014). Another area of focus should be examining which
disparities among women veterans occur locally and which are
present at a national level. Because the VA health care system
comprises geographically disparate sites across all 50 states and
Puerto Rico and because geographic variation in health care has
been identiﬁed as an important contributor to disparities, it will
be important to discern whether observed racial or ethnic differences reﬂect variation in practice in regions or sites that primarily serve women from one racial or ethnic group versus those
that result from systemic inequities.
Several limitations deserve mention. First, we were unable to
perform a meta-analysis owing to the heterogeneity of studies.
Additionally, we cannot rule out the potential for publication bias
in this research area that, if present, could have had a signiﬁcant
impact on our ﬁndings given that we are interested in both the
presence and absence of racial and ethnic disparities. However, a
funnel plot to visualize the effect of publication bias could not be
generated owing to distinct outcome measures in each included

7

study. Additionally, women veterans who receive care in VA
system have worse overall physical and mental health than
women who receive care in the private sector (Frayne et al.,
2006; Washington, Farmer, Mor, Canning, & Yano, 2015). Given
these differences, the results of our review may not generalizable
to women veterans receiving care outside the VA. Last, the
objective of this review was to summarize the extent to which
published literature examines racial or ethnic differences in VA
women’s health care to guide future VA research efforts, not to
determine the full presence and distribution of racial or ethnic
disparities. When a difference represents a disparity and
whether this disparity ultimately is of clinical signiﬁcance must
take into account social context, patient preference, and many
other factors, which cross-sectional studies are often unable to
elucidate and which are beyond the scope of this review. Given
that only nine studies met our inclusion criteria despite our
broad approach, this clearly underscores the extent to which a
comprehensive understanding of racial and ethnic disparities
among woman veterans will not be possible until further
research is done.
Implications for Practice, Policy, and Future Research
In contrast with the wealth of literature examining racial and
ethnic health care disparities both among male veterans and
women in non-VA settings, there are only nine published studies
examining disparities speciﬁcally among women in the VA
Healthcare System. The results of this systematic review
demonstrate that there is a need to further study racial and
ethnic disparities among female VA users. Speciﬁcally, evidence
of racial and ethnic health care disparities among women have
been shown in non-VA settings in cervical cancer screening,
prenatal care, mammograms, and annual preventive visits, but
these areas have not been examined among female VA users.
Also, among male VA users, disparities have been shown in areas
of mental health and substance abuse, cardiovascular disease,
surgical procedures, and pain management, but these areas have
not been examined among female VA users. Our results thus
highlight important knowledge gaps in the ﬁelds of VA health
equity and women’s health research.
Fortunately, an infrastructure to support and facilitate
addressing these knowledge gaps currently exists. The VA requires that special efforts be made to include women and
members of minority groups in all VA research studies including
research that is unfunded, funded by non-VA entities, or funded
by the VA Ofﬁce of Research and Development (U.S. Department
of Veterans Affairs, 2013). Additionally, VA Health Service
Research & Development has funded the development of the
Women’s Health Practice Based Research Network (Frayne et al.,
2013). The Practice Based Research Network establishes a readyto-use infrastructure to conduct multisite studies of women
veterans, which encourage the inclusion of women in research
studies by helping to overcome the issue of small numbers of
women at any one facility. Currently, the Practice Based Research
Network comprises 60 VA sites across the country and has purposefully included many sites with racially and ethnically diverse
female patient populations. The VA Ofﬁce of Health Equity is also
working across the agency to champion the advancement of
health equity and elimination of health disparities for all
vulnerable veteran populations.
Because the VA is dedicated to optimizing women’s health
care, additional research to understand and address racial and
ethnic disparities among women will help to achieve VA’s
