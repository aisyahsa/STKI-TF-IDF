Background: Immunizing health care workers against inﬂuenza is important for preventing and
reducing disease transmission in health care environments. We describe the ability of Canadian health
care organizations to measure inﬂuenza immunization coverage among health care workers and
identify factors associated with comprehensive inﬂuenza immunization measurement.
Methods: A Web-based survey was distributed to inﬂuenza immunization campaign planners responsible for delivering the 2010-2011 inﬂuenza vaccine to health care workers working in acute care
hospitals or long-term continuing care organizations. The primary outcome was the ability to comprehensively measure inﬂuenza immunization coverage.
Results: Of the 1,127 health care organizations approached, 721 (64%) responded. Ninety-one percent
had incomplete immunization coverage measurement; 7% could not measure coverage among any
personnel. After multivariable adjustment, organizations with a written inﬂuenza immunization
implementation plan (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.1-3.5) or a policy or procedure describing
how to calculate or report immunization rates (odds ratio, 2.1; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.2-3.9) were
more likely to have comprehensive measurement of inﬂuenza immunization coverage than organizations without these practices.

Conclusion: Most organizations demonstrated incomplete measurement of inﬂuenza immunization
among health care workers. Given the use of inﬂuenza immunization coverage as a measure of
quality of care, further work is needed to develop a standardized approach to improve its
measurement.

INTRODUCTION

Questionnaire

Many health care and public health organizations in Canada
and the United States have recently introduced measures to
encourage public reporting of inﬂuenza immunization coverage
of health care workers.1-8 The US Healthcare Infection Control
Practices Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on
Immunization Practices released evidence-based recommendations for professionals responsible for inﬂuenza immunization and
infection control programs.9 Two recommendations emphasized
the importance of providing feedback on immunization rates
and of using immunization coverage as a quality of care measure.
However, identifying who has been immunized, who is currently
employed within an organization, and which nonemployee groups
(eg, volunteers) should be included is challenging. Including
different health care workers in numerators (ie, number of health
care workers immunized) or denominators (ie, number of health
care workers who could be immunized) causes inconsistent
coverage estimates.10 This is further compounded by variability
in immunization information accuracy and completeness. Without understanding how immunization coverage is measured, the
comprehensiveness of the data, and the limitations associated
with these indicators, it is difﬁcult to draw valid conclusions for
policies and recommendations and to use coverage as a quality
indicator.
The objectives of our study were to describe the ability of
Canadian health care organizations to measure inﬂuenza immunization coverage of health care workers and to identify factors
associated with comprehensive coverage measurement.

The questionnaire was developed based on a literature review
and research conducted by the Canadian Healthcare Inﬂuenza
Immunization Network (www.chiin.ca) according to established
guidelines11 to identify information gaps in health care worker inﬂuenza immunization and immunization program delivery.12,13 The
questionnaire covered demographics, campaign team/planning/tools,
recording and reporting of immunizations, policies and procedures,
and evaluation activities. Our analysis focused on factors that we
hypothesized to be related to comprehensive measurement of
immunization coverage:
 Type of system used for tracking immunizations (paper, electronic, hybrid of both, or none);
 Having immunization reporting practices;
 Having policies or procedures to support immunization data
collection and reporting (eg, declination forms and immunization documentation);
 Having a mandatory inﬂuenza immunization policy;
 Having an inﬂuenza immunization program implementation
plan;
 Having an interprofessional team involved in planning the
campaign (ie, 5 different types of personnel, including those
involved with occupational health and safety, infection
prevention and control, communications, information technology, pharmacy, administration, senior management, and
union);
 Evaluating the methods used to count and report immunization; and
 Prioritizing vaccine delivery to certain risk groups.

METHODS
Sampling strategy
We identiﬁed individuals responsible for inﬂuenza immunization
of health care workers at acute care hospitals (ACH) or continuing
care (CC) organizations (eg, assisted living facilities, personal care
homes, nursing homes, and long-term care organizations) through
consultation with provincial/regional governments and regional
infection control networks, postings in bulletins, E-mail lists, Web
site advertisements, and calls to organizations identiﬁed on provincial Web sites and lists of hospitals accredited by Accreditation
Canada. We surveyed the person(s) responsible for coordinating the
health care workers immunization campaign, a role undertaken by
public health authorities in some jurisdictions. Individuals responsible for campaigns at more than 1 health care facility under the same
organization were asked to complete 1 survey for multiple facilities
only if the same polices, plans, and procedures applied to all of the
facilities for which they were responsible. These organizations were
deﬁned as “multiple facilities.” Organizations that had both ACH and
CC beds were classiﬁed as “mixed.” We excluded organizations
without acute care or continuing care beds (eg, walk-in clinics). In
addition, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and the Yukon were
excluded because they did not have health care workers-speciﬁc
immunization campaigns.

We pilot-tested the questionnaire in 3 rounds with 12 respondents (directors of care, occupational and infection control
managers, and public health immunization planners).
Survey implementation
To optimize response and minimize recall bias, we mailed prenotice letters with $5 coffee gift cards to respondents in April and
May 2011, following completion of the 2010-2011 inﬂuenza
immunization campaign. One week after mailing pre-notice letters,
we sent an online survey to respondents, followed by 3 e-mail
reminders at intervals of 1 to 3 weeks, and a ﬁnal telephone
reminder to participants who had not responded after the third
email.
Outcome measure
The primary outcome was the ability to measure inﬂuenza
immunization coverage in all health care workers within an organization. Health care workers referred to individuals working in the
organization, regardless of patient contact or employment status
(eg, paid staff, volunteers, students, trainees, physicians, and
contractors). Contractors were workers paid by an external organization. Respondents were asked if they measured the number of

342

S. Quach et al. / American Journal of Infection Control 41 (2013) 340-4

personnel who were immunized (numerator) during the 2010-2011
campaign, and if they knew the total number of health care workers
(denominator) in their organization during the campaign from the
following groups: payroll personnel (eg, nurses), casual personnel
(ie, employed on a temporary basis), nonpayroll physicians, nonpayroll personnel, students or trainees, personnel on extended
leave, and volunteers. These groups were not mutually exclusive.
Organizations were considered to have comprehensive measurement of coverage if they measured the numerator and denominator
across all applicable groups.
Potential confounders included organization size (large or
small), number of facilities under the same organization (single
facility or multiple facilities) and type of organization ACH [ie, had
no continuing care beds], CC [ie, had no acute care beds], or mixed
[ie, had both continuing care and acute care beds]). Large organizations were deﬁned as having 100 beds in a single facility.
Organizations representing more than one facility were also classiﬁed as “large.” All acute care hospitals in Canada are private
not-for-proﬁt organizations that are publicly funded. CC organizations could be public, private not-for-proﬁt, or private for-proﬁt
organizations, and public funding of these organizations varied
across provinces. Due to these complexities, ownership was
excluded from the analysis.
ANALYSIS
We calculated the proportion of organizations that could
measure coverage for all applicable health care worker groups,
stratiﬁed by organization type. Logistic regression models were
ﬁtted to identify variables associated with comprehensive coverage
measurement. We examined univariate models for each factor to
identify those that were statistically signiﬁcantly associated with
the outcome. Only variables that had a P value <.25 were included
in the multivariable model, which controlled for organization size,
type, and number of facilities. Variables were excluded from the
model if they led to complete separation of data, had >10% missing
data, or had no observations in a group. We measured the variance
inﬂation factor for each factor in the multivariable model. We
plotted the deviance, Pearson residuals, and Pregibon leverage
against the predicted probabilities to assess whether the results
were affected by inﬂuential observations. Data analysis was
performed using STATA version 10.0. (2007, StataCorp, LP, College
Station, TX).
ETHICS
This study received ethics approval from the Research Ethics
Boards of the University of Toronto, Capital Health in Halifax, and
Bruyère Continuing Care in Ottawa.
RESULTS
Of the 1,127 immunization planners approached, 721 (64%)
responded. Fifty-two (4.6%) were excluded because their questionnaires were missing data on immunization coverage
measurements, number of beds, and type of organization (ACH vs
CC), or they did not meet our inclusion criterion.
The ﬁnal sample of 669 respondents represented 462 single
facilities (52 ACHs, 391 CC organizations, and 19 mixed), and 207
multiple facilities (16 ACH, 55 CC, and 136 mixed). Most respondents (589 [88%]) were occupational safety personnel, infection
control representatives, or senior administrators. For single facilities, the median number of beds was 152 for ACHs, 100 for CC
organizations, and 77 for mixed organizations.

Coverage measurement
Most respondents measured coverage among personnel on
payroll (n ¼ 614 [92%]) and casual personnel (n ¼ 499 [75%])
(Table 1). Fewer than 50% measured coverage among volunteers,
students and trainees, nonpayroll physicians, nonpayroll personnel,
and personnel on extended leave. Across most health care workers
(except casual and nonpayroll personnel), respondents from ACHs
measured coverage more comprehensively than those from CC
organizations. For example, 38 (56%) respondents from ACHs, but
only 69 (15%) respondents from CC organizations measured
coverage in nonpayroll physicians. A higher proportion of ACHs
than CC organizations were able to measure coverage for their
volunteers (ACH ¼ 38 [56%], CC ¼ 183 [41%]).
Sixty-three organizations (ACH ¼ 7 [11%], CC ¼ 47 [11%], mixed ¼ 9
[6%]) reported that they could measure coverage across their entire
health care worker population. Of these organizations, only 18 (29%)
organizations had all seven health care worker groups in their setting.
Forty-ﬁve organizations (ACH ¼ 4 [6%], CC ¼ 27 [6%], mixed ¼ 14 [9%])
could not measure coverage in any groups.
Inﬂuenza immunization program practices and policies
During the 2010-2011 inﬂuenza season, 45% of respondents
reported having a written implementation plan for their immunization campaign, and 279 of 669 (42%) worked with an interprofessional team to implement the campaign (Table 2). Four
hundred seventy-eight of 669 (71%) respondents reported payroll
personnel coverage to senior management, whereas 334 of 669
(50%) reported this for nonpayroll personnel. Most organizations
collected data on payroll personnel who declined immunization
(n ¼ 447 [67%]), although few collected the same information for
nonpayroll personnel (n ¼ 131 [20%]).
Only 20% of organizations (134/669) reported having mandatory
immunization policies; of these, most were used in continuing care
organizations (ACH ¼ 1 [1%], CC ¼ 117 [26%], mixed ¼ 16 [10%]).
Approximately 32% of organizations (212/669) had a documented
policy or procedure for personnel who declined immunization
(declination process) (ACH ¼ 13 [19%], CC ¼ 168 [38%], mixed ¼ 31
[20%]). Organizations that could comprehensively measure coverage
were signiﬁcantly more likely to have an immunization implementation plan, prioritize vaccine delivery to certain groups, collect
information on declinations, and describe the method used to
calculate or report immunization rates in their policies or procedures
(Table 2).
In the multivariable model (Table 3), organizations that reported
having an implementation plan for their immunization campaign
or a policy or procedure describing how to calculate and/or report
immunization rates were more likely to comprehensively measure
rates than organizations without these characteristics (odds ratio,

DISCUSSION
This is the ﬁrst large-scale study to examine the ability of
Canadian organizations to measure inﬂuenza immunization
coverage of health care workers. It is also the ﬁrst pan-Canadian

study to explore immunization campaign implementation and
the policies or procedures that exist to support coverage
measurement. Unlike previous research in this area that focused on
immunization rates as the primary outcome, our study enquired
about the numerator and denominator separately for each health
care worker group to better distinguish organizations that measure
coverage comprehensively. We revealed signiﬁcant variation in the
ability to measure health care worker immunization coverage, with
most organizations able to do so for only a subset of personnel.
A US study found that nearly all hospitals (98%) measuring
coverage included payroll employees in their rates,12 but <60%
included other types of employees in their coverage estimates.
Compared with health care workers on payroll, it may be challenging
to measure the denominators for other groups becaues they are
generally excluded from the organizations’ payroll databases, and
their lists may be managed externally (eg, colleges and contracting
ﬁrms). Our results demonstrate that some organizations employ
strategies to help support the collection and tracking of immunization
data, such as requiring documentation from personnel vaccinated offsite and requiring declination forms when immunization was refused.
As a starting point for reporting and comparing coverage across
organizations, it would be valuable for organizations to report
subsets of their health care worker population using a standardized
deﬁnition rather than a combined rate consisting of heterogeneous
employee groups. This will allow organizations to identify which
groups are underimmunized while facilitating interorganizational
comparisons.
This study had some limitations. Although we attempted to
identify inﬂuenza immunization campaign planners at organizations
across Canada, this list was not comprehensive. The moderate
response rate among those who were identiﬁed may introduce
response bias. Because some respondents answered once on behalf of

344

S. Quach et al. / American Journal of Infection Control 41 (2013) 340-4

multiple facilities within the same organization, variations in implementation of campaigns among facilities may be substantial. Six
percent of responding organizations did not answer the coveragerelated questions. These organizations may not measure coverage at
all or those responding may not have been knowledgeable about their
organization’s practices. Finally, our deﬁnition of comprehensive
coverage included 7 personnel groups; however, because some
groups are likely to be small relative to others, they may be less
important to capture in immunization coverage measures.
Until organizations uniformly measure coverage, comparisons of
coverage across organizations will be misleading. To achieve accurate and complete measurement, agreement on standard deﬁnitions
for health care worker groups and who should be included in
immunization coverage measurements is required. Further, organizations need standard methods that can be incorporated into their
procedures for collecting immunization information. Once these
have been achieved, organizations can use health care workers’
immunization coverage to support the prevention and control of
inﬂuenza transmission in health care settings.
