Background: Kidney disease disproportionately affects minority populations, including African Americans
and Hispanics; therefore, understanding the relationship of kidney function to cardiovascular (CV) outcomes
within different racial/ethnic groups is of considerable interest. We investigated the relationship between kidney
function and CV events and assessed effect modification by race/ethnicity in the Women’s Health Initiative.
Study Design: Prospective cohort study.
Setting & Participants: Baseline serum creatinine concentrations (assay traceable to isotope-dilution mass
spectrometry standard) of 19,411 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years who self-identified as either
non-Hispanic white (n 5 8,921), African American (n 5 7,436), or Hispanic (n 5 3,054) were used to
calculate estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFRs).
Predictors: Categories of eGFR (exposure); race/ethnicity (effect modifier).
Outcomes: The primary outcome was the composite of 3 physician-adjudicated CV events: myocardial
infarction, stroke, or CV-related death.
Measurements: We evaluated the multivariable-adjusted associations between categories of eGFR and CV
events using proportional hazards regression and formally tested for effect modification by race/ethnicity.
Results: During a mean follow-up of 7.6 years, 1,424 CV events (653 myocardial infarctions, 627 strokes,
and 297 CV-related deaths) were observed. The association between eGFR and CV events was curvilinear;
however, the association of eGFR with CV outcomes differed by race (P 5 0.006). In stratified analyses, we
observed that the U-shaped association was present in non-Hispanic whites, whereas African American
participants had a rather curvilinear relationship, with lower eGFR being associated with higher CV risk,
and higher eGFR, with reduced CV risk. Analyses among Hispanic women were inconclusive owing to few
Hispanic women having very low or high eGFRs and very few events occurring in these categories.
Limitations: Lack of urinary albumin measurements; residual confounding by unmeasured or imprecisely
measured characteristics.
Conclusions: In postmenopausal women, the patterns of association between eGFR and CV risk differed
between non-Hispanic whites and African American women.

populations are disproportionately affected by kidney
disease, with African Americans having a higher risk of
CKD that is more likely to progress to end-stage renal
disease compared with whites.5 Faster kidney function
decline and increased risk of end-stage renal disease
also exist in Hispanics compared with non-Hispanics.6,7
Recent evidence suggests that the association between CKD and CV outcomes may differ by race.4,8
Although previous studies have reported sex differences in the associations of estimated GFR (eGFR)
and albuminuria with CV and all-cause mortality,
relatively little is known about the association between
decreased kidney function and CV risk and its potential modiﬁcation by race or ethnicity among postmenopausal women in the United States.9-13 Because
most existing studies have predominantly examined
white women, more information is needed on women
of other racial/ethnic groups.
The multiethnic Women’s Health Initiative (WHI)
prospective cohort study of postmenopausal women,
for whom creatinine concentrations were measured in
a large subset at baseline, provides an opportunity to
assess the associations of GFR with myocardial
infarction (MI), stroke, and CV death. We hypothesized that these associations would differ among racial
and ethnic groups.

METHODS

After excluding participants whose serum creatinine measurements were not available (n 5 197) and/or those with missing
data on covariates of interest (n 5 2,700), the ﬁnal cohort
included 19,411 participants. There were no clear patterns of
missingness in our covariates and none of the variables we
excluded had missing rates . 5%.

Primary Exposure of Interest
The exposure of interest was eGFR at baseline. Stored frozen
serum specimens were sent to the University of Minnesota2Fairview
laboratory for measurement of baseline creatinine concentrations
and other CV risk markers (discussed next). Serum creatinine was
measured by the Roche enzymatic method on a Roche Modular P
Chemistry Analyzer (Roche Diagnostic Corp) and calibrated against
an isotope-dilution mass spectrometry standard.18 Each patient’s
GFR was then estimated using the CKD-EPI (CKD Epidemiology
Collaboration) equation from serum creatinine concentration, age,
sex, and African American versus non–African American race. The
CKD-EPI creatinine equation has been shown to provide a more accurate estimation of measured GFR compared with previously
established creatinine-based equations.19,20 eGFR was the exposure
of interest in this study and due to a small number of participants with
eGFRs , 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (n 5 46; 0.24%), participants were
divided into the following 6 eGFR strata: ,45, 45 to ,60, 60 to ,75,
75 to ,90, 90 to ,105, and $105 mL/min/1.73 m2.

Study Design and Population
The WHI is a large prospective multicenter cohort study that
focuses on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and
colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal
women aged 50 to 79 years recruited from September 1993
through December 1998. Participants were postmenopausal if they
had had some combination of the following: hysterectomy, double
oophorectomy, conclusion of menstrual bleeding, vasomotor
symptoms, or prescribed hormone therapy. The WHI Study consists of an observational study cohort and 3 clinical trial components (a hormone therapy component, a dietary modiﬁcation
component, and a calcium/vitamin D component). Details of
eligibility criteria, data collection, and ascertainment of health
outcomes have been reported previously (see Item S1, available as
online supplementary material, for WHI clinical trial and observational study design).14,15
Our analysis was restricted to a subset of WHI participants who
participated in the WHI Core Biomarker Studies, including 8,505
African American and 3,503 Hispanic participants who constituted the WHI Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Health
Association Resource (SHARe) cohort and 10,300 participants of
European ancestry who had participated in the WHI Memory
Study,16 an ancillary study of the WHI hormone trials, or whose
samples were analyzed in another WHI ancillary study, the
Genomic and Randomized Trials Network (GARNET) Study
(Fig 1).17 African American and Hispanic participants in the
SHARe cohort were drawn from the observational study and the
clinical trial components. Participants of European ancestry were
drawn from the hormone therapy components. Participants in
these trials provided baseline data on various CV disease biomarkers, including creatinine, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, triglycerides, insulin, glucose, and C-reactive protein.

Race/Ethnicity, eGFR, and CVD

Ascertainment of Outcomes

Statistical Analyses

The primary outcome of interest was the composite of 3 CV
events: MI, stroke, or death related to a CV event. Secondary
outcomes of interest were the individual events that constituted the
composite CV outcome. The diagnosis and adjudication of these
outcomes have been previously described and outlined in established protocols (see Item S1 for CV adjudication information).14

The goal of our analysis was to determine the relationships between
baseline eGFR and composite and individual CV events in this
multiethnic cohort of postmenopausal women, with particular focus
on examining racial/ethnic heterogeneity in all analyses. Relationships among eGFR categories and CV events were modeled using
Cox proportional hazard regression, overall as well as stratiﬁed by
racial/ethnic group. Participants who did not have a CV event or who
died of non-CV causes were censored at the time of death or end of
study period, whichever occurred ﬁrst. The eGFR category with the
lowest rate of CV events was chosen to be the referent group. We ﬁt 4
models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the individual and composite CV outcomes: model 1 estimated unadjusted HRs; model 2
adjusted for age (categorical); model 3 additionally adjusted for
presence of diabetes, history of stroke, and history of MI; model 4
additionally adjusted for BMI, lifestyle factors (physical activity,
history of smoking, and antihypertensive and alcohol use), laboratory
measurements (blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and LDL and HDL
cholesterol), and SF-36 physical function score. All models were
stratiﬁed by cohort (ie, observational study or clinical trial) to allow
different baseline hazards for each cohort. Analyses were explored for
violation of proportional hazards by stratiﬁcation and inspection of the
Kaplan-Meier plots for all outcomes, and no apparent violations were
observed. We examined log-log plots and calculated Schoenfeld residual P values and found no signiﬁcant evidence of departure from
the proportional hazards assumption. In the multivariable-adjusted
Cox proportional hazards model 4, we formally tested for effect
modiﬁcation between race/ethnicity and eGFR category by using a
Wald test to obtain an omnibus P value for interaction between eGFR
categories and the 3 categories of race/ethnicity. Within the interaction model, we also examined the individual contrasts between African Americans versus non-Hispanic whites and between Hispanics
versus non-Hispanic whites. P values for these interaction tests were
assessed at the a , 0.05 level of signiﬁcance.
In order to assess the robustness of our results from a complete
case analytic approach, missing data were imputed using SAS
PROC IMPUTE (SAS Institute Inc) and ﬁt using the primary
analysis models in a sensitivity analysis.
Participants provided written informed consent, and study procedures and protocols were approved by the institutional review
boards at the National Institutes of Health and all 40 participating
institutions. Analyses were performed with SAS software, version
9.4, and R, version 3.1.0, software (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Covariate of Interest: Effect Modiﬁer
We sought to test for effect modiﬁcation of the association between eGFR and CV events by self-identiﬁed race/ethnicity;
participating women had the opportunity to select one of the
following categories: non-Hispanic white, African American, Asian
or Paciﬁc Islander, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian or Alaskan
Native, and other. It was not recorded in the WHI of what race selfidentiﬁed Hispanic participants considered themselves. For the
purpose of this report, we refer to the categories as non-Hispanic
white, African American, and Hispanic with the understanding
that most African American women were likely non-Hispanic and
most Hispanic women were white. Analyses were restricted to
participants who reported 1 of these 3 categories because participants from the SHARe, WHI Memory Study, and GARNET cohorts
with data for CV disease (CVD) biomarkers only include women
from these 3 categories.

Other Covariates: Demographic and Health Characteristics
Details of baseline self- or interview-administered study questionnaires, physical measurements, and blood measurement have
been previously described.14,15 Standardized questionnaires
administered at study entry ascertained sociodemographic characteristics, including age, presence of diabetes, history of MI or stroke,
drinking status (none, past, or current), and smoking status (current,
past, or nonsmoker). Medical history was updated annually for
women in the observational study or semiannually for women in the
clinical trials by mail and/or telephone questionnaires.
Trained clinical center staff obtained anthropometric measurements at the baseline clinic visit. Height was measured with a
calibrated stadiometer, and weight, with a calibrated scale, with
participants in light clothing, without shoes. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in
square meters. Based on BMI, individuals were classiﬁed as being
underweight (BMI , 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (BMI, 18.524.9 kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 25.0-29.9 kg/m2), or obese
(BMI $ 30 kg/m2). Waist circumference was measured at the
narrowest part of the torso, and hip circumference, at the maximal
circumference. Seated systolic blood pressure was measured in the
right arm using a conventional mercury sphygmomanometer after
5 minutes of rest, with an appropriate cuff size based on arm
circumference measurement. Two blood pressure measurements
were taken at least 30 seconds apart and were averaged for the
current analyses.
Physical activity at baseline was assessed using a validated
9-item measure of physical activity from the Personal Habits
Questionnaire and was expressed in metabolic equivalent task
minutes per week.21 Participants were categorized as sedentary,
low, moderate, or high (0, 0.1-,5, 5-,12, or $12 metabolic
equivalent task hours per week).
A quality-of-life measure characterizing physical function was
taken from results of the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF36), which was administered at baseline. This construct ranges
from 0 to 100, with higher values corresponding to better health.22
In addition to creatinine concentrations, C-reactive protein, total
and HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were also measured from
stored biospecimens. The Friedewald equation23 was used to
calculate LDL concentration from total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations.

RESULTS
Baseline Characteristics
From the WHI biomarker cohort, we identiﬁed
22,111 women aged 50 to 79 years who enrolled in the
WHI study between 1993 and 1998 and had a valid
serum creatinine concentration measured. Participants
with missing covariates were excluded (n 5 2,700).
Excluded participants were similar in age to those
included (mean age, 63.5 6 7.4 [standard deviation] vs
63.9 6 7.3 years) but more likely to be non-Hispanic
white (46.4% vs 45.8%). eGFRs were similar for
excluded and included participants (86.9 6 17.3 vs
87.6 616.6 mL/min/1.73 m2). Excluded participants
had a higher rate of CV events (9.5 vs 7.1 per 1,000
years of follow-up).
The ﬁnal analytic cohort of 19,411 women included 8,921 (46.0%) non-Hispanic white, 7,436

(38.3%) African American, and 3,054 (15.7%) Hispanic women (Fig 1). Baseline characteristics of study
participants stratiﬁed by eGFR categories and race/
ethnicity are shown in Table 1. Given the large
cohort, statistically signiﬁcant differences were
observed across racial/ethnic groups for all variables
(all P , 0.05). In general, participants with lower
eGFRs were more likely to be older, have diabetes,
and have a history of MI and stroke, and participants
with lower eGFRs were more likely to have dyslipidemia and higher C-reactive protein levels, irrespective of race and Hispanic ethnicity.
The distribution of eGFRs, stratiﬁed by selfreported race/ethnicity, is shown in Fig 2. Women
self-identifying as Hispanic had a higher median
eGFR (93.9 [interquartile range (IQR), 82.5-100.5]
mL/min/1.73 m2) than that of non-Hispanic whites
(85.7 [IQR, 74.4-92.6] mL/min/1.73 m2) and eGFR
comparable to that of African Americans (93.7 [IQR,
79.3-107.5] mL/min/1.73 m2). The range for eGFRs
was widest for African American participants and
narrowest for non-Hispanic white participants.
Study Outcomes
During a mean follow-up of 7.6 6 1.8 years, 1,392
women had one or more CV events of interest,
including 622 MIs, 597 strokes, and 286 CV deaths
(Table 2). For the composite outcome, we observed
1,360 events across 147,744 person-years of followup. Of note, within the highest eGFR category
($105 mL/min/1.73 m2), no CV events were observed among self-reported Hispanic participants.
In Fig 3, we show adjusted HRs of the composite
CV event across categories of eGFR stratiﬁed by race
and ethnicity. After adjustment for sociodemographic
characteristics, comorbid conditions, lifestyle factors,
and biometric/laboratory data, the association between
eGFR and the composite CV end point was curvilinear
in the overall cohort, but modiﬁed by race/ethnicity
(P for interaction [omnibus test] 5 0.003). Stratumspeciﬁc effect modiﬁcation was found for race (African Americans vs non-Hispanic whites, P 5 0.001),
but not for ethnicity (Hispanics vs non-Hispanic
whites, P 5 0.4). Compared to the referent group
with eGFRs of 75 to ,90 mL/min/1.73 m2, non-Hispanic white participants had a U-shaped relationship
between eGFR and CV events: both higher ($105 mL/
min/1.73 m2) and lower (,45 mL/min/1.73 m2)
eGFRs were associated with higher event rates (HRs of
2.00 [95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 1.24-3.24] and
1.60 [95% CI, 1.01-2.94], respectively; Table S1).
However, among African American participants, a
curvilinear relationship was observed; for the composite CV outcome, compared with participants with
eGFRs in the 75 to ,90 mL/min/1.73 m2 reference
group, eGFRs of 90 to ,105 mL/min/1.73 m2 were

self-identifying as Hispanic had a higher median eGFR (93.9 [interquartile range (IQR), 82.5-100.5] mL/min/1.73 m2) compared with
non-Hispanic whites (85.7 [IQR, 74.4-92.6] mL/min/1.73 m2) and eGFR comparable to African American (93.7 [IQR, 79.3-107.5] mL/

participants.

associated with a lower event rate (HR, 0.62; 95% CI,
0.47-0.83), and eGFRs $ 105 mL/min/1.73 m2 were
associated with an even lower event rate (HR, 0.45;
95% CI, 0.33-0.62). On the other end of the eGFR
spectrum, in the eGFR , 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 category, African American women had similar rates of
composite CV events (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 0.94-2.26) as
those of non-Hispanic white women, but the association was not signiﬁcant. For Hispanic participants,
relative rates of CV events could not be determined in
the highest eGFR category (no events) and were not
signiﬁcantly different from the referent for eGFR
categories # 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. However, Hispanic
women had lower rates of composite CV events in the
category of eGFR of 90 to ,105 mL/min/1.73 m2
(HR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.27-0.59).
Analyses of individual CV events were naturally
limited by fewer events and reduced power. The
association between eGFR and MI in the full study
sample was J-shaped, and the omnibus test for
6

interaction by race/ethnicity was of borderline signiﬁcance (P 5 0.09). Stratum-speciﬁc interaction was
present for African American race versus nonHispanic whites (P 5 0.03), but not for self-reported
Hispanic women versus non-Hispanic whites
(P 5 0.4). In a multivariable model adjusted for patient characteristics and CV risk factors, non-Hispanic
whites with high eGFRs ($105 mL/min/1.73 m2) had
increased rates of MI (HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.07-3.87),
whereas both African Americans and Hispanics had
reduced MI rates with more preserved eGFRs
compared to the reference group. No associations
were found among eGFR categories , 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 for any of the racial and ethnic groups
(Table S2).
Non-Hispanic whites had higher adjusted rates of
stroke at eGFRs , 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 compared
with those in the referent eGFR category (HR, 2.09;
95% CI, 1.05-4.18; Table S3). No signiﬁcant associations were found in any of the other eGFR categories

Americans and Hispanics at eGFRs $ 90 mL/min/

For the outcome of CV death, increased risk was
observed at eGFRs , 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 among nonHispanic whites and ,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 among
African Americans. Hispanic participants had very few
events (n 5 17), leading to rather unstable estimates
(Table S4).
Results of sensitivity analyses using imputation
methods did not differ meaningfully from results of
our main complete case analyses.

DISCUSSION
In this large multiethnic study of postmenopausal
women, we conﬁrmed associations between eGFR,
a kidney disease marker, and CV risk. However, patterns
of association between eGFR and the composite CV
outcome varied signiﬁcantly between non-Hispanic
whites and African Americans, with a U-shaped association for non-Hispanic whites and a rather curvilinear
association for African Americans. The association between eGFR and CV events among Hispanics could not
be evaluated in sufﬁcient detail because there were only
few Hispanic participants and even fewer CV events in
the extreme eGFR categories. Analyses of individual
CV events were naturally limited by reduced precision
due to their small number, but found to be broadly
compatible with the ﬁndings of the composite CV end
point.
The strong relationship between CKD and CV risk
is well established. In a landmark study using data
from Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Go
et al3 described the detailed trajectory of CV risk
across the spectrum of kidney function in adults 20
years or older. Compared with individuals with normal
kidney function (eGFRs $ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 using
the 4-variable MDRD [Modiﬁcation of Diet in Renal
Disease] Study equation), an independent monotonic
increase in risk of CV events was observed for each
successive stratum of GFR decline.3 Moreover, recent
studies have shown that the association between eGFR
and CV risk is even stronger when using the more
accurate CKD-EPI equation or using equations based
on cystatin C measurements instead of or additional to
serum creatinine concentrations.19,20,24
Racial and ethnic disparities in CV risk among individuals with CKD have previously been described.7,25 Peralta et al7 found that among patients with
eGFRs , 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, Hispanic individuals
had 18% lower rates of CV events compared with
otherwise similar non-Hispanic whites. In a pooled
analysis of community-based cohorts, Weiner et al8
found effect modiﬁcation by African American versus
white race of the association between eGFR , 60 mL/
min/1.73 m2 and a composite outcome of nonfatal

Figure 3. Associations between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and time to cardiovascular (CV) events (myocardial
infarction [MI], stroke, and CV death); overall and by racial/ethnic group. In the overall cohort, the association between eGFR and
CV events was curvilinear; effect modification by race and ethnicity was present in an omnibus test (P 5 0.006) and in a stratumspecific test for interaction by non-Hispanic white versus African American racial/ethnic group membership (P 5 0.001). Stratumspecific interaction was not found between Hispanic versus non-Hispanic white racial/ethnic group membership (P 5 0.4). In stratified
analyses, we observed that the U-shaped association was present in non-Hispanic whites, whereas black participants had a curvilinear
relationship, with lower eGFR being associated with reduced CV risk, and higher eGFR, with increased CV risk. Analyses among Hispanic women were inconclusive owing to few Hispanic women having very low or high eGFRs and very few events occurring in these
categories. Multivariable adjustment for hazard rates included age, presence of diabetes, history of stroke, history of MI, body mass
index, physical activity, physical function, history of smoking, history of alcohol use, C-reactive protein level, blood pressure, use of
antihypertensives, and low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Reference group was defined as eGFR of 75-90 mL/
min/1.73 m2.

CV events and all-cause mortality. However, the
reference group included all individuals with
eGFRs $ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and did not use any ﬁner
categorization of eGFR, especially within the relatively
normal range of eGFRs, in which we have found signiﬁcant racial differences.
8

The largest study on the subject to date was a recent
investigation by the CKD Prognosis Consortium, in
which effect modiﬁcation by race (white, African
American, and Asian) of the associations between
kidney markers (eGFR and ACR) with mortality, CV
mortality, and end-stage renal disease was evaluated.26
Am J Kidney Dis. 2015;-(-):---

Race/Ethnicity, eGFR, and CVD

African Americans constituted a small minority of the
1.1 million study participants, but still numbered
almost 50,000 individuals. Despite the large sample
size, the only CV event studied (CV mortality) was
relatively rare and led to wide conﬁdence limits for
African Americans, especially in the extreme ranges of
eGFR. No effect modiﬁcation was found between
whites and African Americans; however, due to the
imprecise estimates in the higher eGFR range, their
conﬁdence bands appear compatible with our ﬁnding
of a curvilinear rather than U-shaped association between eGFR and CV events.
More recently, Gutierrez et al4 identiﬁed racial differences in the association between ACR, the other
marker of kidney disease, and CV events in the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke
(REGARDS) Study. Ultimately, higher urinary albumin excretion was more strongly associated with
incident coronary heart disease risk among African
American individuals as compared with whites.4 A
similar analysis using data from the Atherosclerosis
Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study did not identify
racial differences in the association of ACR with CV
risk. Interestingly, among study participants with
ACRs . 30 mg/g, women had increased CV risk
compared with men (1.3- to 1.8-fold higher HRs).12
This sex-albuminuria interaction on CV risk had previously been described in other cohorts.13,27
In the general population, the risk for CVD among
women increases after menopause, which is believed to
result from loss of the protective effect of estrogen on
lipids and vascular function or a consequence of older
age.28-30 Previous studies using the WHI cohort have
investigated racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk and
mortality—interestingly, no racial/ethnic disparities
were observed in the context of diabetes31 and severe
obesity.32 Few studies have described the relationship
of CVD among women burdened with CKD in the
United States. In 2001, Shlipak et al33 identiﬁed 2,763
postmenopausal women with established CV heart
disease using data from HERS (Heart and Estrogen/
Progestin Replacement Study). After multivariable
adjustment, both mild (1.2-1.4 mg/dL) and moderate
(.1.4 mg/dL) elevations in serum creatinine levels
were independently associated with a 60% to 80%
increased risk for CV events compared with women
with normal kidney function.33 However, potential
effect modiﬁcation by race and ethnicity on the relationship between kidney and CV risk was not explored.
The paradoxically increased CV risk in patients
with higher eGFRs has been previously reported and
attributed to frailty or muscle wasting secondary to
illness, leading to decreased creatinine generation
rather than high level of kidney function.34 Our
observation that this elevated CV risk with high
eGFRs is found in non-Hispanic whites, but not
Am J Kidney Dis. 2015;-(-):---

African Americans, is novel. Although it is possible
that African American WHI participants were less frail
and had more preserved muscle mass, we adjusted for
other markers of frailty or poor health and nutritional
status, including BMI, waist circumference, physical
activity level, and SF-36 Physical Function score.
Although cystatin C has not been proved to be a superior biomarker compared to creatinine, it has a more
linear relationship with CV outcomes in older adults
compared with creatinine, which may have a J- or Ushaped relationship.35,36 Future studies should
examine whether the accuracy of creatinine-based (or
cystatin C–based) estimation equations among individuals with seemingly preserved kidney function
differs among racial and ethnic groups.
This study had several limitations. First, urinary
albumin measurements were not available in WHI to
better discriminate kidney disease burden. This could
introduce probable confounding; however, eGFR and
ACR have been shown to be independent risk factors
for CV events.3 In addition, only single measurements
of creatinine were available and so we were unable to
account for error associated with random intraindividual variability or to analyze kidney and CVD
progression over time. Although race and ethnicity
were collected prospectively, misclassiﬁcation may
have occurred. Furthermore, as with other studies
using interval monitoring of participants’ health
events, under-reporting of CV events may have
occurred. However, recall bias was limited because
CV outcomes were adjudicated by physicians
following participant report.37,38 In addition, although
the CKD-EPI creatinine equation is more accurate
compared to the MDRD Study equation in estimating
GFR and predicting CV risk, a lack of precision in
GFR estimates . 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 has been reported among the black population.39 Moreover,
although we adjusted for various covariates at baseline, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual
confounding by unmeasured confounders. In order to
account for covariates, the analytic cohort differed
from eligible participants in that participants excluded
from the analysis were more likely to be non-Hispanic
white, thus introducing potential selection bias.
Moreover, generalizability of our ﬁndings may be
limited because the study only consisted of relatively
healthy postmenopausal women. Finally, lack of
recruitment of Hispanics with eGFRs in the lower and
higher spectrum of kidney disease and small numbers
of cases in several eGFR categories limited the power
to detect effect modiﬁcation for this ethnic group.
This narrow eGFR range observed among Hispanic
participants may have been the result of selection bias
during recruitment and/or differential participant
nonresponse (in particular, a potentially lower
response among sicker Hispanic women).

Arce et al

In conclusion, using a large, national, and prospectively assembled cohort of diverse postmenopausal women, we found that the patterns of
association between eGFR and CV outcomes varied
by race/ethnicity; the association was U-shaped for
non-Hispanic white women and more curvilinear for
African American women. These ﬁndings add to the
growing body of evidence on the racial differences
in CV risk with reduced kidney function. Future
studies, including ones using cystatin C–based estimations of GFR, need to conﬁrm our ﬁndings of
racially distinct patterns of CV risk from decreased
kidney function.
