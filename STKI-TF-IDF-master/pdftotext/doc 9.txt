Health assessments correlate with health outcomes and subjective well-being.
Immigrants offer an opportunity to study persistent social inﬂuences on health where
the social conditions are not endogenous to individual outcomes. This approach provides a
clear direction of causality from social conditions to health, and in a second stage to wellbeing. Natives and immigrants from across the world residing in 30 European countries are
studied using survey data. The paper applies within country analysis using both linear
regressions and two stage least squares. Natives’ and immigrants’ individual characteristics have similar predictive power for health, except Muslim immigrants who experience
a sizeable health penalty. Average health reports in the immigrant’s birth country have a
signiﬁcant association with the immigrant’s current health. Almost a quarter of the birth
country health variation is brought by the immigrants, while conditioning on
socioeconomic characteristics. There is no evidence of the birth country predictive power
declining neither as the immigrant spends more time in the residence country nor over the
life course. The second stage estimates indicate that a one standard deviation
improvement in health predicts higher happiness by 1.72 point or 0.82 of a standard
deviation, more than four times the happiness difference of changing employment status
from unemployed to employed. Studying life satisfaction yields similar results. Health
improvements predict substantial increases in individual happiness.

1. Introduction
Self-reported health is one of the strongest correlates
with subjective well-being, indicating that health may be
important for individual well-being (Chida and Steptoe,
2008; Easterlin, 2003; Graham, 2010). Subjective wellbeing, happiness or life satisfaction, may also be an
objective of individuals and policy makers. This paper
presents evidence on the relationship between health and
happiness using a method that has a claim to isolate the
causal direction from health to happiness. The paper

extends the literature by using variation in health that
plausibly is not endogenous to the individual’s current
well-being.
Health assessments vary widely both across individuals
within a country and across countries. This paper studies
immigrants in 30 European countries and compares their
health and socioeconomic gradient to natives using survey
data and regression analysis.1 Focusing on immigrants
allows the study of persistent social inﬂuences on selfreported health by combining two approaches in the
literature, as discussed below. Moreover, the persistent

power of socioeconomic characteristics for the outcome, in this case
health.

inﬂuence on health allows estimating the effect of health
on well-being using an instrumental variable approach.
The ultimate contribution of the paper is to estimate the
inﬂuence of health on well-being using a two stage model
where birth country health is used as an instrument for
individual health. The paper makes three additional
contributions to improve estimating the inﬂuence of
health on well-being. First, the socioeconomic gradient
of health, the predictive power of socioeconomic characteristics for health, is estimated for natives and
immigrants. Second, one persistent inﬂuence on selfreported health, mean health assessments in their birth
countries, is estimated among immigrants from across the
globe. Third, it is examined if the birth country inﬂuence on
health dissipates as immigrants spend more time in the
residence country or as they age.
The ﬁrst point on the socioeconomic gradient contributes to the literature on immigrant health which has
shown a weak gradient among Mexican immigrants in the
U.S. (Akresh and Frank, 2008; Rubalcava et al., 2008;
Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2007; Buttenheim et al., 2010;
Goldman et al., 2006; Sanchez-Vaznaugh et al., 2009).
Signiﬁcant differences in the socioeconomic gradient of
health has also been found in the Canadian context, see for
example Wang and Hu (2013). Evidence from Germany
points to small differences, see Nesterko et al. (2013). The
differences between natives and immigrants have been
found to dissipate with time spend in the destination
country; see for example Subedi and Rosenberg (2014).
The estimated gradient reported below is similar, on
average, for natives and immigrants using data on 91
immigrant groups residing in 30 countries.
Moreover, persistent social inﬂuences on health of
immigrants are studied. This combines two strands of the
health literature: social inﬂuences on health and persistent
inﬂuences of early environmental exposures. The literature
has studied how social inﬂuences in the individual’s
current environment correlates with health (Marmot and
Wilkinson, 2006; Berkman and Kawachi, 2000). Another
literature has studied how exposures through the life
course inﬂuence health later in life (Cohen et al., 2010;
Gong et al., 2011; Takeuchi et al., 2007; Ben-Shlomo and
Kuh, 2002) and effects of exposures in utero (Rasmussen,
2001; Almond and Currie, 2011). Health assessment in the
individual’s birth country are related to the health report in
a different environment at a later stage in the life course,
hence combining the perspective of social inﬂuences with
past exposures, to study a novel health inﬂuence channel.
An essential part of the approach is to study social
inﬂuences that are not endogenous to the outcomes of the
individuals studied. Immigrants, whose current health does
not determine the mean health in their birth country, provide
such a setting. The data covers natives and immigrants in
30 European countries between 2002 and 2010. Immigrants
originate from 91 countries across the globe.
The ultimate part of the analysis provides evidence on
how health inﬂuences happiness. The literature thus far
has found strong correlations between health and happiness where the causality could be interpreted in both
directions (Chida and Steptoe, 2008; Easterlin, 2003;
Graham, 2010). Related is also evidence on job satisfaction

(Pagan et al., 2016). Building on the previous analysis of
persistent social inﬂuence on health among migrants, a
two stage approach is applied that can provide evidence on
the causal inﬂuence of health on happiness. Birth country
health is used as an instrument of individual health in
estimating the inﬂuence of health on happiness. The
estimates provide evidence on the causal effect of health
on happiness given that the instrument is relevant (which
is shown in the ﬁrst part of the analysis) and the exclusion
restriction holds (which can never be known with
certainty). The instrumental variables approach in this
paper complements other approaches to studying the
causal relationships between health and well-being such
as the structural equations model in Gana et al. (2013)
which impose different assumptions to yield stronger
causal evidence than cross sectional correlation studies.
2. Methods
2.1. Empirical models
The ﬁrst part of the analysis applies a linear ordinary
least squares (OLS) model. The main type of analysis is
regressions of the following form:
0

Healthicat ¼ b0 þ bk X icat þ b1 Mean Healtha þ g ct
þ eicat

(1)

Healthicat captures the self-reported health in period t of
individual i, residing in country c, and born in country a.
Xicat captures individual demographic and socioeconomic
controls, as well as parental characteristics, that may affect
health. The associated vector of coefﬁcients is denoted by
b0k . The country of residence-by-year ﬁxed effect is denoted
by gct, and eicat is the error term. This regression is run on
samples of natives and immigrants. The mean level of
ancestral country health assessment, Mean_Healtha, is
common to all individuals born in country a. This term is
included when studying immigrants, and in this case a 6¼ c.
Ancestral country and birth country are used interchangeably in this paper. All standard errors are clustered by the
individual’s birth country to allow for arbitrary correlations of the error terms among individuals with the same
birth country (Angrist and Pischke, 2009). The results
presented below are based on a linear model but the
results are robust to using the ordered Logit or the ordered
Probit estimator. All regression parameter estimates are
unstandardized.
The inclusion of the country-by-year ﬁxed effect gct
means that the institutional structure and all other
unobserved differences which apply to all residents in
country c in period t (such as the mean self-reported health
and the residence country health system) are accounted
for. It also means that the variation used to identify the
estimate on ancestral health assessment is to compare the
outcomes of immigrants within each country of residence
and year relative to the values in their birth countries. For
example, the comparison is if immigrants residing in
France born in Denmark, a country with high health
assessment, have higher health assessments than the
immigrants in France born in Portugal, a country with

M. Ljunge / Economics and Human Biology 22 (2016) 35–46

lower health assessment. The country-by-year ﬁxed effects
account for level differences across countries (timeinvariant inﬂuences on the outcome variables) and nonlinear trends within each country.2 The method and
related literature are discussed further in the literature
(Fernandez, 2010; Fernández and Fogli, 2009), and has also
been applied to the study of health among children of
immigrants (Ljunge, 2014).
The second part of the analysis studies how health
predicts well-being. The model is that health may
inﬂuence happiness. To address reverse causality, that
happiness determines health, the model is estimated in
two stages. In the ﬁrst stage health is modeled as
determined in part by birth country health, Eq. (1) above.
The second stage equation is:
0

Happinessicat ¼ b2 þ bm X icat þ b3 Healthicat þ g 0ct þ e0icat (2)
Happinessicat captures the subjective well-being of an
individual. Eqs. (1) and (2) are estimated using two stage
least squares (2SLS); see for example Angrist and Pischke
(2009) for details. Birth country health is hence used as an
instrument for individual health. The relevance of the
instrument is established in the ﬁrst part of the analysis
where estimates of (1) are presented. The exclusion
restriction, that conditional on the controls birth country
health has no direct effect on happiness of migrants, is
examined through robustness checks. Although impossible
to be certain that the exclusion restriction holds the
robustness analysis makes it plausible that it could be valid.
2.2. Data
The main data set is the European Social Survey (ESS).
Representative samples are drawn for each country and
round. Participating countries by round are listed in
Appendix Table A1. The survey includes information on
the country of birth of the respondent. From this it is possible
to identify immigrants and which countries they originate
from. Looking at 30 European countries of residence reduces
the concern that the results are driven by conditions of one
country. Individuals with ancestry from 91 countries across
all continents are observed. The broad range of immigrants
reduces the concern that the results are particular to a small
number of ancestral backgrounds. The summary statistics
are presented in Table 1. The immigrants are similar to the
general population on observables including their selfreported health and well-being. There are some differences
with more migrants having a higher education (while
slightly fewer have an upper secondary degree) and more
Muslims relative other denominations.
The cumulative ﬁrst to fourth round ESS ﬁle is amended
with the ﬁfth round. The ﬁrst round was collected in 2002;
second round in 2004; the third round in 2006; the fourth
round in 2008; and the ﬁfth round in 2010. The residence

Compared to a model with country and year ﬁxed effects the countryby-year speciﬁcation used relaxes the assumption that time trends are
the same across countries. In practice, the less ﬂexible model with
country and year effects deliver similar results as the country-by-year
ﬁxed effects speciﬁcation.

countries included are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian
Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
Turkey, Ukraine, and United Kingdom. Extensive documentation of the data is available at http://ess.nsd.uib.no/.
A summary of variable names, descriptions, and sources for
all the variables are found in Appendix Table A2.
2.2.1. Self-reported Health
Self-reported health is measured by one question in the
ESS (the variable name is ‘‘health’’). The interviewer asks
‘‘How is your health in general? Would you say it is. . .’’ and
reads out the categories ‘‘Very good,’’ ‘‘Good,’’ ‘‘Fair,’’ ‘‘Bad,’’
‘‘Or, very bad.’’ ‘‘Very good’’ is coded with a 5 and each
following category with a lower digit.
2.2.2. Subjective well-being
One question in the ESS is about subjective well-being
(the variable name is ‘‘happy’’). The interviewer asks
‘‘Taking all things together, how happy would you say you
are?’’ The answers are given on a scale from ‘‘Extremely
unhappy’’, coded as 0, to ‘‘Extremely happy’’, coded as 10.
2.2.3. Life satisfaction
Life satisfaction is assessed by one question in the ESS
(the variable name is ‘‘stlife’’). The interviewer asks ‘‘All
things considered, how satisﬁed are you with your life as a
whole nowadays?’’ The answers are given on a scale from
‘‘Extremely dissatisﬁed’’, coded as 0, to ‘‘Extremely
satisﬁed’’, coded as 10.
2.2.4. Individual variables
Age, gender, marital status, education, income, employment status, and religious afﬁliation are recorded in
the ESS. Marital status is captured by two dummies for
married and never married, with widowed and divorced
being the excluded category.3 Education is captured by one
dummy for tertiary (university) degree and above, and one
dummy for upper secondary as the highest attained
degree.4 Lower education is the excluded category. One
dummy captures income in the top three deciles, High
Income, and one dummy for the middle four deciles,
Middle Income.5 One dummy captures individuals who are
out of the labor force (students, not employed and not
looking for work, and retired) and another dummy for
unemployed who look for work.6 Those employed is the
omitted category. Religion dummies for being Catholic,
Protestant, or Muslim are included while other denominations are the excluded category.7

3
Marital status indicators are derived from the variables ‘‘marital’’,
‘‘marlfr’’, ‘‘maritala’’, and ‘‘maritalb’’ that capture marital status across
waves and France.
4
These indicators are based on the variables ‘‘edulvla’’ and ‘‘edulvlb’’.
5
Income categories are derived from the variables ‘‘hinctnt’’ and
‘‘hinctnta’’.
6
Employment status indicators are derived from the variable
‘‘mnactic’’.
7
The religious categories are derived from the variable ‘‘rlgdnm’’.

Notes: Data from the European Social Survey, rounds 1 through 5. The
immigrant sample refers to individuals born in a country different from
the country of residence (where the survey is conducted).

2.2.5. Parental characteristics
There is information on the education and labor supply
of the individual’s parents (labor supply refers to labor
market status being market work, either employed or selfemployed). Dummies are created for both the mother and
father if the parent has an upper secondary or tertiary
degree. Dummies are also created for if the father or
mother was working when the immigrant was age 14.8
2.2.6. Health assessments in the country of birth
Average health assessment in the country of birth is
computed in the integrated European Values Survey and
the World Values Survey (EVS/WVS). This allows expanding the analysis of immigrants beyond those with ancestry
in the countries covered by the ESS. The EVS/WVS health
measure can be matched with immigrants from 91 nations
across the globe. Extensive documentation is available at
www.worldvaluessurvey.org.
The health assessment question has the following
formulation in the EVS/WVS, ‘‘All in all, how would you

describe your state of health these days? Would you say it
is. . .’’ The answers are coded 1 for ‘‘Very poor,’’ 2 ‘‘Poor,’’ 3
‘‘Fair,’’ 4 ‘‘Good,’’ and 5 ‘‘Very good.’’ Averages are
computed for all countries and across the waves (collected
between 1981 and 2008) to capture persistent mean health
assessments.
2.2.7. Additional ancestral country characteristics
Birth country health, the variable of main interest in the
analysis on persistent health inﬂuences below, is related to
other ancestral country characteristics. There is a positive
relationship between health and income across countries.
We do not want to confound the effect of ancestry from a
more developed country with the effect of a higher health
country. The log of the ancestral country’s gross domestic
product (GDP) per capita is used to measure the effect of
ancestry from a more developed nation.
Moreover, ancestral country health outcomes can
inﬂuence the health of immigrants. This is accounted for
by controlling for life expectancy at birth and infant
mortality (per 1000 births). Also accounted for is inequality
through the ratio between the incomes of the top compared
to the bottom 20%. All these measures are taken from the
World Development Indicators (WDI) provided by the
World Bank. For documentation see http://data.worldbank.
org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators. The degree of democracy is measured by the polity2 variable
from the Polity IV project. For documentation see http://
www.systemicpeace.org/polity/polity4.htm. A data compilation is used as the source for these birth country
characteristics (Samanni et al., 2010; The Quality of
Government Institute cross-country data set).
Average subjective well-being (happiness) in the birth
country is measured across the ﬁve waves of the EVS/WVS
(the surveys were conducted between 1981 and 2008). The
happiness question in EVS/WVS is ‘‘Taking all things
together, would you say you are:’’ where answers are given
by ‘‘Very happy’’, ‘‘Quite happy’’, ‘‘Not very happy’’, and
‘‘Not at all happy’’.
2.2.8. Missing observations
There are 16 (0.10%) missing observations of health in
the immigrant estimation sample. Health report missing is
not signiﬁcantly associated with individual control variables, except that those who are unemployed are less likely
to not report health. In the native sample there are 251
(0.12%) missing observations of health. All individual
characteristics are insigniﬁcant except Protestants who are
more likely to report health. For subjective well-being
there are 144 (0.86%) missing observations in the
immigrant estimation sample. Not reporting happiness
is not signiﬁcantly associated with any of the control
variables. This indicates that the analysis is not biased by
non-responses of the dependent variables.

Notes: The dependent variable is self-assessed health, which ranges from 1, ‘very bad’ to 5 ‘very good.’ Column (1) estimates the association socio-economic
gradient for the native population (born in the country of residence). Column (2) restricts the sample to immigrants (not born in the country of residence).
Column (3) studies immigrants and estimates the effect of health assessments in the country of birth on the immigrant’s self-reported health, while only
accounting for the most exogenous individual characteristics. Column (4) adds socioeconomic characteristics of the individual, and column (5) adds
parental characteristics. High income is a dummy for the top three deciles. Middle income is a dummy for the middle four deciles. Country of residence-byyear ﬁxed effects included in all speciﬁcations. Data is from the ﬁrst to ﬁfth waves of the European Social Survey. Standard errors in parenthesis. Standard
errors allow for clustering on the individual’s birth country. Models estimated with ordinary least squares.

and immigrants, respectively. The speciﬁcations include
the same individual and parental characteristics. The
estimates on the individual characteristics are very similar
across the two groups with one notable exception. Muslim
immigrants pay a health penalty while there is no such
effect for native Muslims. The health penalty for Muslim
immigrants is of similar size as having less than an

secondary degree (versus having one) or being three
deciles lower in the income distribution; a sizeable effect.
The associations of education, income, labor force and
marital status are similar across groups.
The associations of parental education and labor supply
are largely similar across the groups, although the effects
are less signiﬁcant for the immigrants. For immigrants the

40

M. Ljunge / Economics and Human Biology 22 (2016) 35–46

estimate on the mother having a tertiary degree is close to
zero and insigniﬁcant, while there is a positive and
signiﬁcant estimate for natives. For immigrants the
estimate on the father having a tertiary degree is not
signiﬁcantly different from zero, but the point estimate is
close to that in the native sample. The estimate of a
working mom (at age 14) is close to zero in the immigrant
sample, while there is a penalty in the native sample. The
results indicate that parental characteristics may be less
important for immigrants compared to natives. The
estimates on parental characteristics are less precisely
estimated than the individual characteristics so the lack of
signiﬁcance of parental characteristics in the immigrant
sample could reﬂect the larger uncertainty rather than
actual differences in estimates.
Comparing the estimates of the socioeconomic characteristics between natives in column 1 and immigrants in
column 2 of Table 2 reveals that the socioeconomic
gradient is not signiﬁcantly different between natives and
immigrants, with one exception.9 Muslim immigrants
express signiﬁcantly worse health while there is no such
effect among natives.
One implication of the similar socioeconomic gradients
is that immigrants do not seem to be selected differentially
compared to the native population. Immigrants hence
appear representative of the native population with
respect to the health determinants considered. The
possible exception is Muslim immigrants.
The similar socioeconomic gradients for health among
natives and immigrants in the European context contrast
with the healthy immigrant effect found in studies using
US and Canadian data, where the socioeconomic gradient
differs for natives and immigrants. The results presented
here are in line with Nesterko et al. (2013) ﬁnding of only
very small health differences between German natives and
immigrants. Both the summary statistics in Table 1 and the
analysis in Table 2 discussed point to no signiﬁcant health
differences among natives and immigrants in a broader
European context. The results point to a difference in
immigrant health determinants between Europe and
North America.
3.2. Persistent predictive power on self-reported health
The health assessments of immigrants from across the
world are systematically related to the average health
assessments in their birth country. The pattern is
illustrated in Fig. 1. The horizontal axis measures the
mean health assessment in the immigrant’s birth country.
The vertical axis captures the self-reported health difference between an immigrant group and natives, averaged
across the 30 residence countries.
The positive relationship in Fig. 1 implies that immigrants
bring their birth country health with them to their residence
country. The ﬁgure plots the 41 largest immigrant groups

Given that estimates are not signiﬁcantly different between natives
and immigrants, it may not be informative to compute quantitative
differences across groups based on point estimates that could measure
the same underlying parameter.

Fig. 1. Health assessment in the birth country and self-reported health of
immigrants compared to natives. Health assessment is measured from 1,
very bad, to 5, very good. Self-reported health deviations on the vertical
axis are from the national average (across 30 nations). The sample is
immigrants in 30 European countries. Country labels follow ISO-3166.
Data are from the European Social Survey and the World Values Survey.

but it is very similar for the full sample. The analysis
accounts for individual socioeconomic and birth country
characteristics, yet the relationship stays ﬁrmly positive.
The ﬁndings provide new evidence on how health is
shaped by social forces beyond the current context.
The remaining three columns of Table 2 address if there is
a persistent predictive power of health assessments in the
birth country on the immigrant’s current health status. In
the third column self-reported health is regressed on the
average health assessment in the country of birth, age, age
squared, a gender dummy, and a full set of country of
residence by year ﬁxed effects. The estimate on health in the
birth country is positive and highly signiﬁcant. Immigrants
in a given country of residence who were born in a country
with a high health assessment express relatively higher
health compared to immigrants residing in the same
country but who were born in a country with lower average
health assessments. The signiﬁcant estimate on birth
country health indicates a persistent social inﬂuence on
self-reported health. Persistent social inﬂuence refers to the
lasting predicting power of a contextual factor in the
individual’s environment, where the focus in the analysis is
on birth country average health assessments.
The fourth speciﬁcation of Table 2 adds socio-economic
characteristics of the individual to account in detail for the
immigrant’s current status. The predictive power of birth
country health remains positive and strongly signiﬁcant.
Column 5 of Table 2 adds parental characteristics to the
model, which slightly decrease the standard error on the
persistent health estimate. The results are very similar if
Muslim immigrants are excluded, indicating that the
possible selection effect among Muslim immigrants do not
affect the results.
A one standard deviation increase in mean birth
country health corresponds to the marriage premium or
being four years younger. The effect is just shy of the
association of an upper secondary degree (compared to
less education) and bigger than moving from the low to the
middle income category. A one unit increase in the mean

41

(Wilkinson and Pickett, 2009). There is no signiﬁcant
inﬂuence on the health of immigrants, although the point
estimate is as hypothesized. Column 5 accounts for the level
of democratization, and ﬁnds evidence that greater democracy promotes health.
Column 6 of Table 3 estimates a cumulative model with
all the birth country factors. In this speciﬁcation only the
birth country health assessment remains signiﬁcant. Its
point estimate and signiﬁcance is robust across speciﬁcations, indicating a persistent social inﬂuence on selfreported health. That the point estimates remain similar
across speciﬁcations suggest that omitted factors might be
of limited concern. The results are very similar if Muslim
immigrants are excluded from the analysis.

health of the birth country, increasing the health from
Russia’s level to Denmark’s, parallels the effect of being
twelve years younger and exceeds the effect of having a
university degree (compared to having less than an upper
secondary degree). The literature has argued that estimates of environmental factors on self-assessed health are
a lower bound (Grafova et al., 2014).
3.2.1. Robustness to ancestral country factors
Conditions in the birth country other than health
assessments could of course inﬂuence the immigrant later
in life. Table 3 explores a number of plausible candidates. The
ﬁrst column accounts for GDP followed by two measures of
objective health in the birth country: life expectancy and
infant mortality. The estimates have the expected signs,
higher development and better health measures promote
health among immigrants, and are also signiﬁcant. Column 4
of Table 3 accounts for the ratio between the income shares
of the top and bottom 20%, a measure argued to hurt health

3.2.2. Adaptation
The acculturation of the birth country factors predictive
power on self-reported health has been studied by Jasso
(2003). The last two columns of Table 3 study adaptation of

health assessment in two dimensions: based on years since
immigration and age. Column 7 interacts the health
assessment in the birth country with an indicator for
whether the immigrant has spent more than 20 years in
the country of residence. About 53% of the immigrants
have lived more than 20 years in the country of residence.
A signiﬁcant negative estimate on the interaction term
would indicate that the health assessments of those who
have lived more than 20 years in the country are less
affected by the birth country inﬂuence. Hence, it measures
if individuals adapt their health assessment when they live
longer in the country of residence. The point estimate on
the interaction term in column 7 of Table 3 is close to zero
and insigniﬁcant. There is hence no evidence of adaptation
in the birth country predictive power on health reports as
immigrants spend more time in the country.
In column 8 of Table 3 the health assessment in the
birth country is interacted with an indicator for whether
the individual is at least 47 years old, the sample average
age. The idea is to examine if there is adaptation in the
birth country predictive power over the life course. There is
no evidence of adaptation of health assessments over the
life course.10 The estimated coefﬁcient on the interaction
term is close to zero and insigniﬁcant.
3.3. Estimating the effect of health on subjective well-being
The previous section establishes that birth country
average health signiﬁcantly predicts individual health of
migrants living in a different country. This result provides
the basis for examining the effect of health on subjective
well-being, since birth country health is plausibly not
determined by the well-being of individuals living in
different countries. This section presents the second stage
estimates of a two stage model of (1) and (2).
The ﬁrst column of Table 4 presents the second stage
estimates of well-being on health where health is
instrumented for by mean birth country health. Only the
most exogenous individual controls, age, its square, and
gender, are included. The estimate on health is positive and
highly signiﬁcant.
Extensive individual controls (education, marital and
labor market status, income, religion) are added in
column 2 of Table 4. The addition of these controls has a
negligible inﬂuence on the estimate on health, which
remains similar in magnitude and signiﬁcance. The
estimates on the demographic characteristics are similar
to those in the literature (married individuals are
happier, those unemployed looking for work are less
happy); see for example Graham (2010) and Easterlin
(2003). The results are very similar if Muslim immigrants are excluded.
The point estimate indicates a substantial positive
impact of health on subjective well-being. A one standard
deviation increase in health implies a 1.72 point, or .82 of a
standard deviation, increase in happiness. The estimated
effect size of health is several times larger than the

10
Similar results are found when using three groups; older than 20,
older than 40, and older than 60 years of age.

estimates of the biggest demographic associations. The
implied happiness gain of a one standard deviation
increase in health is over three times the inﬂuence of
being married (compared to being divorced or widowed)
and over four times the happiness gain moving the
employment status from unemployed looking for work
to working.
The concern with the instrumental variable approach is
that there are relevant omitted variables. Birth country
characteristics correlated with birth country health could
inﬂuence happiness. Several plausible candidates were
examined in Section 3.2.1. Column 3 of Table 4 adds the
cumulative speciﬁcation with birth country characteristics
from the mentioned section (log of GDP per capita, life
expectancy, infant mortality, top vs. bottom income
shares, and democracy) to the two stage model. The
estimate on health remains positive and signiﬁcant, while
all the added birth country characteristics are insigniﬁcant
except life expectancy.
Since the outcome variable is happiness there may be
the added concern that happiness persists from the birth
country. To address this concern the fourth column of
Table 4 adds the birth country mean happiness to the two
stage model. The estimate on birth country happiness is
close to zero and insigniﬁcant while health remains
positive and signiﬁcant.
The F-statistics for exclusion of the instrument in the
ﬁrst stage are reported at the bottom part of Table 4. The
ﬁrst speciﬁcation with minimal individual controls comes
in slightly under the common 10 threshold as an indicator
of a sufﬁciently strong instrument. The precision of the
model increases when adding individual characteristics.
The F-statistic for the exclusion of the instrument increases
to 17, indicating a very strong ﬁrst stage. Adding the ﬁve
birth country characteristics in the third speciﬁcation has
little effect on the ﬁrst stage strength. Adding birth country
happiness has little effect on point estimates, and is itself
insigniﬁcant, but due to covariation with birth country
health the ﬁrst stage is not as strong. Yet, the F-statistic
comes in at the threshold value 10. The relevance of the
instrument is hence established. Further details on the ﬁrst
stage estimates are found in Appendix Table A3. Each
column in Table A3 reports the ﬁrst stage estimates for the
model corresponding to the same column in Table 4.
The exclusion restriction is not possible to test in this
exactly identiﬁed model. Omitted variables correlated
with the instrument and outcome is always a concern.
Potential omitted variables could include productivity and
human capital that correlate with birth country average
health. The robustness analysis includes GDP per capita
and life expectancy, factors that arguably would capture
differences in productivity and human capital across birth
countries. Moreover, individual controls for education,
labor force attachment, and income also account for the
individual’s productivity and human capital. The robustness of the results to a wide range of birth country factors
and individual characteristics indicate that no other major
factor is likely to inﬂuence the result.
Additional evidence on how health affects subjective
well-being comes from studying life satisfaction. There is a
strongly signiﬁcant predictive power of health on life

Notes: The dependent variable in columns 1 through 4 is happiness, which ranges from 0, ‘extremely dissatisﬁed’ to 10 ‘extremely happy.’ The dependent
variable in column 5 is life satisfaction, which ranges from 0, ‘extremely unhappy’ to 10 ‘extremely satisﬁed.’ All speciﬁcations study immigrants and
estimate the effect of health assessment on happiness, where health is instrumented for with birth country mean health assessment. The table presents the
second stage estimates of the two stage least squares model. First stage estimates presented in Appendix Table A3. Individual controls include age, age
squared, gender, education, labor force attachment, income, and religious denomination as in Table 2. Country of residence-by-year ﬁxed effects are
included in all speciﬁcations. Data is from the ﬁrst to ﬁfth waves of the European Social Survey. Standard errors in parenthesis, which allow for clustering on

satisfaction in column 5 of Table 4 using the same two
stage estimation procedure and extensive controls as in the
previous column. The result corroborates the interpretation that health improves subjective well-being by
demonstrating the effect on life satisfaction, a measure
distinct from but related to happiness. The ﬁrst stage
results for life satisfaction are very similar to the previous
speciﬁcations, both in terms of estimates and ﬁrst
stage strength (the ﬁrst stage is reported in column 5 of
Table A3).
4. Discussion
Immigrants and natives look alike (Table 1) and have
similar health gradients (columns 1–2, Table 2). These
observations are consistent with the weak evidence of
immigrant sorting on health (Akresh and Frank, 2008;

Rubalcava et al., 2008) and supplements earlier studies that
have found different socioeconomic gradients, in particular
between U.S. natives and immigrants from Latin America
(Acevedo-Garcia et al., 2007; Buttenheim et al., 2010;
Goldman et al., 2006; Sanchez-Vaznaugh et al., 2009).
The similarities between immigrants and natives make it
plausible that the persistent inﬂuences on health, and in the
second stage well-being, estimated among immigrants
could generalize to natives. If this is the case then targeted
health policy interventions could beneﬁt the general
population.
Although no speciﬁc health interventions have been
studied in this paper the analysis would suggest that
interventions that improve health both have long lasting
effects on health as well as contributes to individual
happiness. The individual correlates suggest that avoiding
unemployment is associated with both better health and

44

M. Ljunge / Economics and Human Biology 22 (2016) 35–46

greater happiness. Higher education is associated with
better health (but does not signiﬁcantly contribute to
happiness when health is accounted for). This suggests
that education interventions that keep people out of
unemployment could have substantial returns both in
health and happiness among both healthy and health
impaired workers.
Birth country income inequality does not have a
signiﬁcant effect on immigrant health reports, indicating
such effects are not persistent. The lack of persistence, if
capturing a true effect of income inequality close to zero
(rather than imprecise measurement), suggests that policy
interventions could be effective if inequality causes poor
health (Marmot and Wilkinson, 2006; Wilkinson and
Pickett, 2009). Had income inequality been found to persist
when individuals move to a different context it might have
been more challenging for policy to overcome such
persistence.
The effects of mean health in the birth country on
current health are quantitatively signiﬁcant. They are
comparable to much studied socioeconomic inﬂuences
such as education, income, marriage, and age. The effect
size makes it relevant to contemplate policy interventions
to improve health. Moreover, the social inﬂuence on
individual health indicates spillover effects.
The predictive power of birth country health assessment on individual health could be interpreted as causal
as the immigrant residing in a different country cannot
plausibly affect the average value in the birth country.
This causal direction is a strength of the approach
studying immigrants, which is hard to achieve in
samples of natives. The robustness of the estimate when
accounting for individual, parental, and birth country
characteristics adds power to the causal interpretation.
Yet, one can never completely rule out the inﬂuence of
omitted factors.
The persistent social inﬂuences on health have two
implications. First, social inﬂuences on health assessments
imply a potential for spillovers from improved health
beyond those directly affected. Second, the persistent
predictive power of birth country health on health
assessment, over and above a wide range of current
socioeconomic factors, implies long-lasting effects on
health. Policy that promotes health assessments could
have positive health effects both contemporaneously and
over the individual’s whole life course. Policy interventions
may also beneﬁt individuals not directly treated by the
intervention through the social feedback from the treated
individuals.
The two stage estimates provide evidence on the
direction and magnitude of the effect of health on
subjective well-being. The instrumental variables approach offers new evidence on the causal relationship of
health and well-being (measured by happiness and life
satisfaction) where the current literature has largely
focused on individual correlations where causality could
run in both directions. The results are in line with, Gana
et al. (2013), who ﬁnds that subjective health predicts
subjective well-being in a subsequent year. The causal
interpretation of the two stage estimate presented in
this paper is of course conditional on the identifying

assumption that birth country health has no
direct inﬂuence on happiness of migrants beyond the
speciﬁed model. This is an untestable assumption
inherent in the instrumental variable approach, yet
the robustness checks of the two stage model indicate
that it could be plausible that the identifying assumption
holds.
The two stage estimate of health on happiness (and life
satisfaction), when interpreted causally, has one essential
implication. Health is a very important determinant of
individual well-being, quantitatively much more important than other demographic and economic characteristics.
The ﬁndings reinforce the importance for both policy
makers and individuals themselves to improve health as a
means to higher well-being.

Notes: The dependent variable is self-assessed health, which ranges from 1, ‘very bad’ to 5 ‘very good.’ The table presents the ﬁrst stage estimates of the two
stage least squares model where Table 4 presents the second stage estimates. Each column corresponds to the sample in the same numbered column in
Table 4. Individual controls include age, age squared, gender, education, labor force attachment, income, and religious denomination as in Table 2. Country
of residence-by-year ﬁxed effects are included in all speciﬁcations. Data is from the ﬁrst to ﬁfth waves of the European Social Survey. Standard errors in
parenthesis, which allow for clustering on birth country.
