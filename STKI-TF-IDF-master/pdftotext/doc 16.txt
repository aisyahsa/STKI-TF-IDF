Background: Health checks beneﬁt adolescents and adults with intellectual disability, however uptake is low despite government–funded incentives.
Aim: To assess the characteristics of people with intellectual disability who, when offered
a health check with their primary care physician at no cost, completed the health check.
Methods and procedures: Data from three randomised controlled trials considering health
checks in people with intellectual disability living in the community were included in an
individual-patient data meta-analysis. The studies used the same health check and the
participant characteristics investigated (age, sex, cause of disability, level of disability and
socio-economic position) were deﬁned identically, but participants were sourced from different settings: adults living in 24-h supported accommodation, adults living in private
dwellings, and school-attending adolescents.
Outcomes and results: In total 715 participants were offered health checks. Compared to participants with Down syndrome, participants with other known causes of disability were
more likely not to attend their health check (odds ratio;95%CI) = (2.5;1.4–4.7), as were
participants with no known cause of disability (2.3;1.2–4.3). These associations remained
signiﬁcant after adjusting for potentially confounding variables.
Conclusion and implication: Down syndrome was the only characteristic positively associated with health check attendance across all study settings. Future research should focus
on strategies to increase health check uptake in this population.

What this paper adds
People with intellectual disability have poor health and healthcare and subsequently shorter lifespans than their peers in
the general population. Health checks are the only tool used at the primary care level that have high-quality evidence showing
their uptake leads to beneﬁcial effects on health outcomes in adults with intellectual disability. Despite government–funded
incentives, health check uptake is low. Data from 715 participants from three randomised controlled trials conducted by

the same research team were combined. An investigation of the characteristics of participants who completed their health
checks showed that people with Down syndrome were signiﬁcantly more likely to complete their checks than people with
any other cause of disability. No other characteristic examined was associated with health check uptake. Future research
should focus on the reasons for the differential uptake among people with intellectual disability, and the development of
strategies to increase uptake in this highly marginalised population.

1. Introduction
People with intellectual disability have poorer health and shorter lifespans than the general population, as well as high
levels of unrecognised disease, and inadequate health screening and promotion (Emerson & Baines, 2010; Heslop et al., 2014;
Taggart & Cousins, 2014). An investigation of the circumstances of 244 deaths of English people with intellectual disability
found that up to 37% of deaths could have been avoided through the provision of good quality healthcare, and that the
median ages at death of males and females with intellectual disability were 13 and 20 years younger than their peers in the
general population (Heslop et al., 2014). An Australian study found the standardised mortality ratios for males and females
with intellectual disability aged 5–69 years compared with the general population were 2.52 and 4.26 respectively (Florio
& Trollor, 2015). The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare disability survey found people with intellectual disability
aged under 65 years have a number of other associated disabilities including problems in the physical (49%), psychiatric
(57%) and sensory/speech realms (44%) (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2008). These levels of disability were
congruent with clinical research ﬁndings from overseas and in Australia (Baxter et al., 2005; Beange, Lennox, & Parmenter,
1999; van-Schrojenstein-Lantman-De-Valk, Metsemakers, Haveman, & Crebolder, 2000).
Health checks are the only intervention implemented at the primary care level with high quality evidence showing
they decrease unmet health need in people with intellectual disability (Bryne, Lennox, & Ware, 2016; Robertson, Hatton,
Emerson, & Baines, 2014). Many developed countries, including Australia, have introduced government funded health check
programs for this population. In the United Kingdom (UK) health checks for adults with intellectual disability were introduced
in primary care services in Wales in 2006, primarily based on evidence from studies involving the Cardiff Health Check that
showed health checks identify new health needs and increase health promotion activities (Baxter et al., 2005; Felce et al.,
2008a, 2008b). They were introduced as a Directed Enhanced Service, with primary care practices ﬁnancially rewarded for
conducting heath checks. This scheme was extended to England in 2008. Despite government funding uptake of health
checks is mixed. In Australia less than 1% of eligible adults with intellectual disability received a health check between July
2007 and August 2009, the last years for which data is available (Koritsas, Iacono, & Davis, 2012), whereas in England 44% of
those eligible received a health check in 2013/2014 (Public Health England, 2014). This difference can partially be explained
by the different health care systems, for example in the UK patients register with a general practitioner and checks are more
fully embedded within the practice.
European studies investigating the characteristics of health check attendees in non-disabled adults have found inconsistent associations between demographic and social characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity, education, marital status
and socio-economic position, and health check attendance (Assendelft et al., 2012; Cochrane et al., 2013; Dalton, Bittle,
Okom, Majeed, & Millett, 2011). The only two studies to consider the association between individual characteristics and
health check attendance among people with intellectual disability were both retrospective audits of routinely collected
data. One study of adults in Northern Ireland found that health checks were less likely to be undertaken by those living with
family carers and by those living in more socially deprived areas (McConkey, Taggart, & Kane, 2015), while an English study
found that health checks were less likely among younger adults and those living in more socially deprived areas (Buszewicz
et al., 2014).
An Australian Academic Research Centre has run three randomised trials investigating the health beneﬁts of health checks
in people with intellectual disability living in the community. The Endeavour Foundation trial (EF-CHAP) was conducted
among adults living in 24-h supported accommodation in 2000–2001, with participants randomised to receive either a
health check or usual care (Lennox et al., 2007). The Advocacy and Health (A&H) trial was conducted among adults living
in private dwellings in 2004–2005 (Lennox et al., 2010). The A&H trial was a 2 × 2 factorial study; the two interventions
studied were a health check and a personalised health diary designed for ongoing use. The Ask Study was conducted among
adolescents attending secondary school in 2006–2010, with participants randomised to receive either a health intervention
package consisting of health education, a health diary and a health check, or usual care (Lennox et al., 2012). Similarities
between trials were the use of the same health check (the Comprehensive Health Assessment Program), that participants
lived in the community and were recruited from the same geographical region, and that participant characteristics were
recorded using the same criteria. Differences between trials were the age and residences of participants, and that the health
check may have been received with other health interventions in the A&H and Ask studies. In each trial participants allocated
to receive a health check may, or may not, have attended an appointment with their primary care physician to complete
their health check. This study combines data from these three trials in an individual participant data meta-analysis, the aim
of which is to identify whether age, sex, cause of disability, level of disability or social position are associated with health
check attendance.

2. Material and methods
The three trials included in this meta-analysis were all undertaken among adolescents and adults with intellectual disability living in the community in South East Queensland, Australia. Each trial examined the effect of a health check, with or
without additional intervention (a health diary in the A&H and health education and health diary in the Ask). Participant-level
data from each study was extracted, checked and synthesised prior to analysis. All studies were approved by the Behavioural
and Social Sciences Ethical Review Committee of The University of Queensland. In each study consent was given formally
by the person with intellectual disability (or their parent/carer for Ask Study participants), their main residential carer and
their primary care physician.
The health check used in each trial was the Comprehensive Health Assessment Program (CHAP). The CHAP is a booklet
designed for one-off use. It is ﬁrst completed by the person with disability and their carer who provide a detailed medical
history, and then by the primary care physician, who is prompted to review the history, perform the health check and
develop a health action plan. In the EF-CHAP and A&H trials participants allocated to receive a health check were sent CHAP
booklets soon after randomisation and requested to book an appointment with their regular primary care physician. In
the Ask trial participants were sent CHAP booklets approximately six months after returning baseline questionnaires. In all
cases there was no cost to the person with disability to attend the appointment. In all trials participants were requested to
return the health check booklet to the study team immediately after their primary care consultation. The medical records
of participants allocated to receive a health check but who did not return their booklets were examined to identify whether
a health check had occurred. A health check was deﬁned to have occurred if either the health check booklet was received
by the study team or there was clear evidence from the medical records that a health check had been completed.
Baseline characteristics collected on all participants at recruitment were age, sex, cause and level of disability, and
postcode of residence. Age was categorised as 18–29 years, 30–44 years, or 45+ years. Cause of disability was classiﬁed
according to carer report as either Down syndrome, other known cause (for example another syndrome or neonatal trauma)
or cause unknown. Level of disability was classiﬁed as mild or moderate if the participant had IQ assessed as between 55 and
70 on an individually administered IQ test and adaptive behaviour deﬁcits, and as severe or profound if they were assessed to
have IQ less than 55 and adaptive behaviour deﬁcits. Socio-economic position was measured at the postcode level using the
Australian Bureau of Statistics developed Socio-Economic Index for Areas, a measure of Relative Disadvantage (Australian
Bureau of Statistics, 2012). All variables were collected using the same deﬁnitions in all studies.

3. Calculation
Summary statistics are reported as frequency(percentage). An individual participant meta-analysis combined results
from the three studies using a three-level mixed-effects logistic regression, with primary care physician nested within
study (EF-CHAP/A&H/Ask) and both physician and study treated as random-effects to account for possible study-speciﬁc
or physician-speciﬁc dependence. Association between participant characteristics and health check attendance was ﬁrst
investigated univariably, and then multivariably. Multivariable models include all measured characteristics as covariables.
Due to the sampled population (school attenders) in the Ask study, the range of ages was restricted and level of disability
was not collected. Consequently Ask study participants were excluded from any age- or disability-level related analysis
(as we would not be able to distinguish age/disability-level effects from study effects). The association between participant
characteristics and health check attendance was then repeated separately for each study, with physician treated as a random
effect, in order to investigate any study-speciﬁc effects. Effect estimates are reported as odds ratio (95% conﬁdence interval).
Analysis was undertaken using Stata statistical software v12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

4. Results
The total number of individuals allocated to receive health checks was 715: 234 in the EF-CHAP, 134 in the A&H and 347
in the Ask. Individuals were mostly male (57.6%) and 16.5% had Down syndrome. The percentage of individuals completing
their health checks was signiﬁcantly higher in the EF-CHAP (92.7%) and A&H (84.6%) than in the Ask (51.9%).
The only characteristic signiﬁcantly associated with health check attendance was cause of disability (Table 1). Compared
to participants with Down syndrome, participants with other causes of disability and with no known cause of disability
were more likely not to attend their health check (OR (95%CI) = 2.5 (1.4, 4.7) and 2.3 (1.2, 4.3) respectively). These associations remained signiﬁcant after adjusting for other measured characteristics. No other participant characteristic appears to
inﬂuence health check attendance.
When investigated by individual study, the magnitude of the observed association between cause of disability and health
check attendance was remarkably consistent between studies, although the effect is only statistically signiﬁcant for the Ask
Study (Table 2). For the two adult studies the conﬁdence intervals are wide due to the smaller sample sizes and higher
overall health check uptake, nevertheless it appears that individuals with Down syndrome may be more likely to attend
health checks across life stages and style of accommodation.

5. Discussion
People with Down syndrome living in the community were signiﬁcantly more likely to attend no-cost health checks than
either people with other causes of intellectual disability or people whose intellectual disability has no known cause. The
magnitude of the effect was similar for both adults and adolescents, and for adults was not dependent on residential setting.
Individuals with Down syndrome are at higher risk of comorbid disease, especially sensory impairments and musculoskeletal
disorders, than individuals with other causes of intellectual disability (Torr, Strydom, Patti, & Jokinen, 2010). In people with
Down syndrome these comorbidities also occur earlier in life, which may have inﬂuenced their willingness to attend their
health check (either individually or through their carers).
Strengths of this study are its large sample size, and that the data combined for these analyses originated from three
trials conducted from the same Academic Centre. All studies were undertaken in the same geographic region, used the
same health check, and outcome measures and data extraction procedures were consistent. All participants lived in the
community, however the key difference between studies was in the population sampled: either adults who lived in 24 h
supported accommodation (EF-CHAP) or private dwellings (A&H), or school-attending adolescents (Ask). Due to the relatively
small sample sizes in the individual studies, effect estimates are imprecise when analysed by study, however the direction
and magnitude of estimates is generally consistent across studies.
Data used in this study derives from participants who had enrolled in a research study, with demographic, social and
clinical characteristics of participants collected prospectively. Consequently the information is more likely to be valid than
information used in other studies, which is often registry data. Although cause of disability was reported by the carer (usually
a parent), identiﬁcation of Down syndrome is likely to be accurate as a previous validation study reported a positive predictive
value for maternally reported Down syndrome of 100% (Rasmussen, Mulinare, Khoury, & Maloney, 1990).
It is possible that some participants may have attended the health check but not returned the booklet and not had the
visit recorded in their medical records. However the number of individuals in this situation is likely to be small as when
medical records of participants who returned their booklets for the EF-CHAP were examined it was demonstrated that in 70%
of cases where a health check was conducted this could be identiﬁed in the medical records. No participant in the EF-CHAP
or A&H who did not return their health check booklet had health check attendance recorded in their medical records, and
this occurred for only four Ask participants.
Fewer Ask study participants completed their health checks, possibly reﬂecting the age of the participants and the longer
time between study enrolment and scheduled health check attendance than in the adult studies. Parents of adolescents
who did not attend the health check were asked why at the exit interview, with 37% saying they were too busy, 10% that
the adolescent would not attend, and 8% that they see their doctor too often for other reasons already. Other reasons for
non-attendance were that it was difﬁcult to access their doctor and they considered it unnecessary as the adolescent was
healthy.
Results in this study do not reﬂect those found in previous research that has considered health check uptake in this
population, which found that health checks were less likely to be undertaken by younger adults living with families, or
independently, and by those living in more socially deprived areas (Buszewicz et al., 2014; McConkey et al., 2015). We did

not ﬁnd an association between health check attendance and either age or socio-economic position, while neither McConkey
and colleagues or Buszewicz and colleagues considered reason for disability in their analyses. McConkey and colleagues used
anonymised data to investigate characteristics of primary care clinics according to the proportion of clients with intellectual
disability who had a health check, and found that uptake was increased in localities where clinics had access to staff known
as ‘health facilitators’, who were registered intellectual disability nurses or members of community intellectual disability
teams. Health facilitators liaised with primary care practices to identify patients with intellectual disability, encouraged the
patients to attend a health check, and then assisted during the check and with any follow-up actions. While the employment
of health facilitators was successful in the UK, its effect would be more limited in the Australian primary care system where
individuals do not register with a primary care clinic, and many people with intellectual disability have no regular physician.
Results from this study are likely to be generalisable to a wide range of adolescents and adults with intellectual disability
in high income countries, as the study participants are representative of the population in such countries, with regards to
age, gender, level of intellectual disability, and types of community accommodation/support arrangements.
5.1. Conclusion
A health check is the only primary care level intervention that is effective at reducing unmet health needs in this population
that is supported by gold standard randomised trial evidence. Current uptake of health checks is low. Although UK studies
have demonstrated that uptake can be increased by introducing a more intensive identiﬁcation and contact process led by
intellectual disability professionals within primary care clinics, that approach is not practical in many health systems. By
focussing on the characteristics of individuals with intellectual disability associated with non-attendance, more effective
strategies for increasing uptake can be developed.
