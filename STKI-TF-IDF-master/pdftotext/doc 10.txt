1. Background

AC

Health promotion and prevention is an essential strategy for managing the growing needs of elderly
people and for reducing population health disparities in the primary health care setting. In many
countries, the introduction of advanced practice nurses has been a reaction to the changing health
needs of society (McIlfatrick et al., 2014). However, both experience and research have found
several issues that challenge the development of advanced nursing practice in primary health care.
For example, nurses’ capacity to implement health-promotion practices is affected by organizational
factors such as a positive health culture including wellness planning, workplace milieu, the
development of organization members, and the appreciation of health promotion by health care
organization managers (Johansson et al., 2010). On the other hand, health promotion training has
been found to increase nurses’ motivation to implement health promotion practices in nursing
(Brobeck et al., 2013), as well as their own lives to improve their health and well-being (Roelen et
al., 2013). Clients’ commitment to a healthy lifestyle, their motivation for self-care, and community
resources (such as the availability of preventive services) have also been found to enhance the

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

4

success of health promotion (Findholt et al., 2013). Additionally, health has become a political
priority across governments; for example, the European Union’s (EU’s) health strategy ―Together
for Health‖ emphasizes actions that focus on protecting people from health threats and diseases, and

T

that promote positive lifestyle choices, and workplace health and safety, taking into account the

RI
P

―health in all policies‖ principle (European Union, 2014).

Advanced nursing practices have become significant in improving health promotive care in the
primary health care setting. Therefore, this study aimed to: (1) identify the elements needed for the

SC

success of HPPs delivered by registered nurses (RNs) who receive clients in primary health care
and (2) to reach a consensus on those elements among primary health care participants (RNs who

MA
NU

received clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians, health promotion officers, and local
councilors) in eastern Finland.

Health promotion involves not only actions directed at strengthening the skills and capabilities of
individuals; it has also developed towards the achievement of health equity and seeing health as a
human right and political priority (World Health Organization, 2013). While health and health

ED

promotion are largely defined by actions taken based on the social determinants of health and as
part of public health thinking (Van den Broucke, 2013), nurses are suggested to be more active in

PT

health promotion practice in primary health care (Roden et al., 2015).
The foundations for advanced practice nurses were established in the United States in 1965, with

CE

the development of the work of nurse practitioners (NPs) who were found to meet the growing
needs of health promotion in primary health care (Donald et al., 2013). Even though advanced
practice nurses work in a variety of nursing fields, the educational requirements vary greatly across

AC

countries, and there is also a lack of consistency in the legislative systems and regulatory
mechanisms that recognize advanced nursing practices (Carney, 2015). However, there are many
similarities between advanced practice nurses in the countries where they have been introduced, as
follows: they are RNs with continuing education and training; they embody competencies required
to work autonomously both in hospital and primary health care settings; and they apply a variety of
preventive care activities in nursing, such as promoting a healthy lifestyle and giving counselling on
health risks (e.g., American Association of Nurse Practitioners, 2013; Royal College of Nursing,
2012; Nursing and Midwifery Board of Australia, 2013).
In Finland, primary health care is provided by local authorities and covers public health services,
health promotion, and any related provision of health counselling and health checks (The New
Health Care Act, 2010). The target group of this study—RNs, who are authorized by the National
Supervisory Authority for Welfare and Health (Valvira) and have additional education in nursing
areas (such as wound care, or cardiovascular or diabetes preventive care)—are able to receive

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

5

various client groups supported by doctor’s consultation or in collaboration with a doctor
(Delamaire & Lafortune, 2010; National Institute for Health and Welfare, 2013). However, health
promotion is challenging: in provinces in eastern Finland (Northern Karelia, Northern Savo and

T

Kainuu), where younger generations move to large cities because of a lack of job opportunities,

RI
P

around 20% of the population is older than 65, and long-term conditions—such as mental health
problems and diabetes, as well as unhealthy lifestyle behaviour, for example obesity, smoking, and

SC

alcohol consumption—are more common than elsewhere in Finland (Eurostat, 2014).

2. Methods

In this study, a mixed method two-stage Delphi technique was applied, consisting of both
qualitative and quantitative approaches. The Delphi survey includes several data collection phases
or ―rounds,‖ and seeks to gain the most reliable consensus of opinion from a group of participants
(Keeney et al., 2001). The Delphi technique was considered appropriate for exploring the elements

ED

required for the success of the health promotion practices delivered by RNs (who received clients in
primary health care) with diverse backgrounds and from geographically dispersed locations

PT

(Keeney et al., 2001). There is no single definition for what constitutes a level of consensus. For
example, 75% has been suggested as an acceptable level (McElhinney, 2010); however, there is no

CE

obvious scientific rationale for this (Keeney et al., 2006). In this study, the consensus level was set
at 51% (or over) agreement.

3. Participants

An information letter was sent to all 34 primary health centers in three provinces in eastern Finland.
Eleven responded and volunteered to participate in this study. They were from four health centers in
Northern Karelia, four in Northern Savo, and three in Kainuu. Directors of nursing (matrons and
head nurses) at primary health care centers suggested possible participants; they were contacted by
the researcher, who asked for their consent to be involved in this study. Inclusion criteria for the
participants in this Delphi study were applied according to Keeney et al. (2001), requiring that they
were familiar with the research topic and willing to contribute throughout the Delphi survey. The
participants (RNs who receive clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians and health promotion
officers, and local councilors) were required to have been employed for five years or longer in
primary health care and they had to have had experience of either working autonomously as an RN
who receives clients or experience of working as part of a pair or team working with an RN who

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

6

receives clients. For local councilors the requirement was that they were familiar with primary
health care and had a nursing education background.
At the beginning of the study, there were 42 participants, including 18 RNs (who received clients),

background information of the participants is described in Table 1.

4. Data collection

MA
NU

The data collection began in the first round with semi-structured interviews with the primary health
care participants (n = 42) between April and July 2009 (see Table 1). The aim was to identify the
elements needed for the success of health promotion practices delivered by RNs who receive clients
in primary health care. Focused questions based on the literature were developed around the
following themes: the organizational aspects of primary health care; RNs’ own health behaviour

ED

and opportunities for further education and health promotion training; primary health care clientrelated aspects; and political decision-making aspects. The interviews were conducted in a similar

PT

manner in the participants’ workplaces and were tape-recorded and transcribed. The information
from the qualitative study formed the basis for a questionnaire used in the quantitative survey in the

CE

second Delphi round. This questionnaire was pre-tested with five RNs (who received clients) in
primary health care centers who were not involved in the research. Some changes in the wording
were made on the basis of their feedback.

AC

The data collection continued in the second round with a questionnaire consisting of 17 statements,
each of them scored on a five-point Likert scale: 1 (completely agree), 2 (partially agree), 3
(partially disagree), 4 (strongly disagree), and 5 (neither agree nor disagree). The data were
collected in January and March 2011. The aim was to reach a consensus on the elements identified
among primary health care participants (RNs who receive clients, directors of nursing, senior
physicians, health promotion officers, and local councilors) in eastern Finland. In order to maximize
consensus, additional participants were included in the survey. The questionnaire was sent to 87
individuals including the participants who had been interviewed (n = 42) as well as to directors of
nursing, RNs (who received clients), and senior physicians in the same 11 primary health centers
who had not participated in the semi-structured interviews. The response rate was 64%. The
questionnaire was returned by 56 participants: 31 RNs (who received clients), 14 directors of
nursing, 5 senior physicians, 3 health promotion officers, and 3 local councilors (see Table 1).

5. Data analysis

The data analysis involved management of both qualitative and quantitative information gathered

T

from interviews and the questionnaire. Qualitative interview data was analyzed systematically by

RI
P

applying the concept map method according to the recommendations of Novak (2002). Qualitative
data from the first Delphi round were diverse, which is why a concept mapping method was useful
in data analysis as it clarifies conceptual understanding and provides a strategy for analyzing and

SC

organizing information systematically (Kemppainen et al., 2013). According to Novak (2002),
concept mapping involves six phases: 1) identifying a key question that focuses on the purpose of

MA
NU

the concept map, 2) identifying key concepts using the key question and beginning to construct the
concept map by placing the key concepts at the top of the hierarchy, 3) selecting defining concepts,
4) arranging key concepts in a hierarchy, 5) combining the concepts by connecting concepts in
different segments or domains of the concept map and giving the links a one- or two-word name,
and 6) adding specific examples that clarify the meaning of the concept if desired.

ED

In this study, three researchers were involved in the concept-mapping process. First, one researcher
read through all the transcribed interviews, and the key concepts and defining concepts were

PT

identified by the aim of the study in the interview material. Second, the same researcher began to
construct the concept map hierarchically. This goal was achieved by placing the key concepts on the

CE

top left-hand side of a page and then listing definitions of those concepts down the middle of the
page. Two supervising researchers verified the first and second phases of the concept-mapping
process. Third, one researcher continued the construction of the concept map by combining the key

AC

concepts and definition concepts using links that were then named. The concept maps were then
critically evaluated by the supervising researchers. Fourth, the researcher selected examples from
participants’ interviews and listed these on the right-hand side of each page for clarification.
The second Delphi round’s quantitative data were analyzed with SPSS® Statistics (v21.0; IBM
Corporation, Somers, NY, USA). Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies and percentages, were
used to report responses and the consensus of the primary health care participants.

6. Ethical approval

This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Kuopio University Hospital
(statement number 120/2008). The researcher also provided information regarding the study both
orally and in written form, and participants gave written and oral consent.

care in eastern Finland. Among the participants of this study, a consensus level of 51% (or over)
was reached for fifteen of the identified elements required for success while no consensus was
reached for two of them.

SC

Seven of the elements required for the success of health promotion practices were related to
primary health care organization; they were considered to represent a key concept of health-

promoting organizational culture (see Figure 1). The highest levels of consensus were reached for
organizations’ respectful attitude towards health (89.3%) and having sufficient resources for health
promotion practices (83.9%) among the participants. According to the results of this study, primary
health care leaders’ appreciation of health promotion reached a consensus level of 80.4%.
Organizations’ action plan for health promotion reached a consensus level of 71.4% in this study.

among the participants of this study. A final identified element related to health promoting
organization culture was development projects for health promotion, but it did not reach a

consensus in this study (level of agreement: 48.2%).

This study found two of the elements required for the success of health promotion practices related

AC

to nurses’ professional growth and nurses’ work well-being that were considered to demonstrate the
key concept of nurses’ health orientation and development (see Figure 2). Consensus levels of
71.4% and 71.4% were reached in the systematic documentation of health promotion practices in
clients’ electronic health records and the opportunity for continuing education in health promotion,
respectively. No consensus (level of agreement: 28.6%) was reached among participants regarding
having contacts with public health researchers as an identified element required for the success of
HPP, whereas the opportunity to consult a colleague (another RN who sees clients) showed a
consensus level of 82.1%. The requirements for nurses’ own health behavior reached a consensus
level of 64.3% in this study and the opportunity to receive supervision for challenging client,
57.1%.

This study found two of the elements required for the success of the health promotion practices

clients’ approach to being healthy (see Figure 3). The requirement for the availability of health
promotion practices (e.g., living a short distance from preventive services) reached a consensus
level of 75.0% among the participants and client’s commitment to self-care, 69.6%.

Two of the elements required for the success of health promotion practices were found related to
political decision-making; these were considered to demonstrate the key concept of health policy
(see Figure 4). The requirement for municipal decision-making on public health promotion (e.g., to

build sports centers and offer cheaper exercise choices) had a consensus level of 69.6% in this
study and national legislation on public health promotion (e.g., tighter tobacco and alcohol laws)

had a consensus level of 57.1%. Table 2 presents the summary of the results of this study.

ED

8. Discussion

In this study, consensus was reached among primary health care participants (RNs who received

PT

clients, directors of nursing, senior physicians, health promotion officers, and local councilors) on
15 elements required for the success of health promotion practices delivered by RNs who received

CE

clients in primary health care in eastern Finland.
Firstly, a health-promoting organizational culture (e.g., an organization’s respectful attitude
towards health, sufficient resources for health promotion practices, and primary health care leaders’

AC

appreciation of health promotion) reached the highest levels of consensus (between 60.7% and
89.3%) in this study. A positive health culture and the leadership of health promotion within an
organization have been found to play a major role in creating opportunities for nurses to implement
health promotion practices in nursing (Johansson et al., 2010). Additionally, the systematic
leadership of health promotion provides direction, defining a vision and strategy for health
promotion (Johansson et al., 2010; Beaudet et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important to develop
collaboration between advanced nursing practices and directors of nursing that may provide a
framework for the establishment of a collegial and supportive working relationship.
Secondly, this study revealed nurses’ health orientation and development to be an element required
for the success of the health promotion practices delivered by RNs who receive clients in primary
health care. Nurses’ professional growth included the systematic documentation of health
promotion in the clients’ electronic records, and opportunities for continuing education and health
promotion training. The use of electronic health records has been found to be common and

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

10

meaningful, especially in care coordination in advanced practice nursing (Narcisse et al. 2013). This
study indicated that the systematic documentation of health promotion in clients’ health records
enhanced individual health-promotive care. On the other hand, continuing education and health

RI
P

motivation for health promotion practices (Brobeck et al., 2013).

T

promotion training are significant for nurses’ professional development as they can provide

This study showed that nurses’ health orientation and development also consisted of nurses’ work
well-being. We may consider that the findings of this study support the traditional view that nurses

SC

are perceived to engage in healthy activities, and that fatigue and long-term conditions among
nurses can reduce the quality of their nursing care (Roelen et al., 2013). It is also suggested that

MA
NU

health promotion interventions for nurses should be ones with a holistic wellness approach, fostered
in the workplace (McElligott et al., 2009). However, the results of this study also indicated that the
opportunity to consult other RNs who receive clients and that supervision were elements required
for the success of the HPP due to the increasing complexity of clients in primary health care. As
nurses’ work well-being seemed to be a significant element for the success of HPP, it is

ED

recommended that primary health care centers develop wellness programs for RNs who receive
clients.

PT

Thirdly, the findings of this study indicated that clients’ approach to being healthy was a required
element for the success of health promotion practices delivered by RNs who received clients in

CE

primary health care. In this study, clients’ approach to being healthy incorporated the availability of
health-promotion activities and commitment to self-care. Clients have been considered as coproducers of the implementation of healthy lifestyle promotion in primary health care. This means

AC

taking into account clients’ individual approaches to being healthy and managing being healthy
(Thomas et al., 2014). Indeed, this challenges RNs who receive clients in primary health care to
develop, together with other health care professionals, electronic services that support clients’ selfcare online.
Finally, this study found health policy to be an element required for the success of health promotion
practices delivered by RNs who receive clients in primary health care. In recent years, health
promotion has become a priority in many countries, and controlling health care costs is now
considered a key issue in terms of economic stability and social growth. For example, the EU’s
health strategy (European Union, 2014) emphasizes that governments’ health policy and local
community policies play a key role in areas such as regional and environmental policy, tobacco
taxation, and the regulation of pharmaceuticals and food produce.
In summary, this study revealed required elements for the success of health promotion practices
provided by RNs who receive clients in primary health care to be a health-promoting organizational

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

11

culture with sufficient resources for health promotion and primary health care leaders’ appreciation
and also an action plan for health promotion, quality management systems for health promotion,
and the management of health promotion. Therefore, our recommendation is that these elements are

RI
P

T

worth considering when developing health promotion practices in the primary health care setting.

9. Limitations

SC

Despite their long tradition as a valid research technique and having been widely applied in health
research there are potential limitations inherent in the Delphi technique. Firstly, Keeney et al.

MA
NU

(2001) point out that the results of a Delphi study should be regarded in the same way as the results
of any qualitative research, which is why the findings of this study should be generalized with
caution. Secondly, the participants of this study represented diverse backgrounds and knowledge,
improving the content validity of the Delphi study (Keeney et al., 2001). Thirdly, we conducted a
pilot survey for the semi-structured interview themes and the questionnaire, which improved the

ED

feasibility and reliability of the study results (McIlrath et al., 2010). Finally, although the data were
collected both six and four years ago, the findings of this study are still relevant in the Finnish

PT

context. Today, primary health care is citizens’ first point of contact with health care services, RNs
deliver a variety of health promotion practices for diverse client groups, and the goal is to maintain

CE

and improve health as well as prevent illnesses in the population (National Institute for Health and
Welfare, 2013; Government publications, 2015).

AC

10. Conclusions

In order to strengthen public health thinking in the primary health care setting, this study is of
significance to primary health care leaders, nursing practice, and political decision-makers because
it clearly revealed the elements required for the success of health promotion practices delivered by
RNs who receive clients in primary health care. In particular, those elements seemed to be related to
a health-promoting organizational culture with strategic and respectful leadership of health
promotion as well as nurses’ health orientation and development, including nurses’ work wellbeing, and opportunities for continuing education and training.
