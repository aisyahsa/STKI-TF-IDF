The spiritual health of adolescents is a topic of emerging contemporary importance. Limited numbers of
international studies provide evidence about developmental patterns of this aspect of health during the
adolescent years. Using multidimensional indicators of spiritual health that have been adapted for use
within younger adolescent populations, we therefore: (1) describe aspects of the perceptions of the
importance of spiritual health of adolescents by developmental stage and within genders; (2) conduct
similar analyses across measures related to speciﬁc domains of adolescent spiritual health; (3) relate
perceptions of spiritual health to self-perceived personal health status. Cross-sectional surveys were
administered to adolescent populations in school settings during 2013–2014. Participants (n ¼45,967)
included eligible and consenting students aged 11–15 years in sampled schools from six European and
North American countries. Our primary measures of spiritual health consisted of eight questions in four
domains (perceived importance of connections to: self, others, nature, and the transcendent). Sociodemographic factors included age, gender, and country of origin. Self-perceived personal health status
was assessed using a simple composite measure. Self-rated importance of spiritual health, both overall
and within most questions and domains, declined as young people aged. This declining pattern persisted
for both genders and in all countries, and was most notable for the domains of “connections with nature”
and “connections with the transcendent”. Girls consistently rated their perceptions of the importance of
spiritual health higher than boys. Spiritual health and its domains related strongly and consistently with
self-perceived personal health status. While limited by the 8-item measure of perceived spiritual health
employed, study ﬁndings conﬁrm developmental theories proposed from qualitative observation, provide foundational evidence for the planning and targeting of interventions centered on adolescent
spiritual health practices, and direction for the study of spiritual health in a general population health
survey context.

and joy in life (Bone, Cullen, & Loveridge, 2007), moral sensitivities
(Hay & Nye, 1998) and the idea of “connectedness” (Palmer, 2009;
Hay & Nye, 1998). It relates to a range of experiences, from those
that are life afﬁrming to those that are painful (Eaude, 2003).
Further, spirituality has been described as “the intrinsic human
capacity for self-transcendence in which the individual participates in the sacred—something greater than the self” (Yust,
Johnson, Sasso, & Roehlkepartain, 2006). Spiritual health has been
recognized as a fourth dimension of health (along with social,
emotional/mental and physical domains) (Dhar, Chaturvedi, &
Nandan, 2011, 2013; Hawks, Hull, Thalman, & Richins, 1995; Miller

& Thoresen, 2003; Udermann, 2000), and we understand it to be
under this broader construct of spirituality.
While the spiritual dimension of health has re-emerged as part
of an important discussion in health literature, there is little consensus in the literature as to a concise deﬁnition (Hawks et al.,
1995; Vader, 2006). Because this ﬁeld is evolving, we argue that it
is premature to propose a single, succinct deﬁnition as being able
to capture this multi-dimensional and somewhat elusive construct. However, in order to facilitate dialogue, we propose the
following working deﬁnition. Spiritual health is a dimension of
health that entails a condition of spiritual well-being. This is a "way
of being" that involves some capacity for awareness of the sacred
qualities of life experiences and is characterized by connections in
four domains: (1) connections to self, (2) others, (3) nature, and
(4) with a sense of mystery or larger meaning to life, or whatever one
considers to be ultimate. Spiritual development is also important to
consider. It relates to the developmental process of nurturing the
human capacity for spiritual health. Benson, Roehlkepartain, and
Rude (2003) describe it as the “developmental ‘engine’ that propels the search for connectedness, meaning, purpose, and contribution” (Benson et al., 2003, p. 205). While our study has the
narrow focus of describing developmental patterns related to
perceptions of the importance of spiritual health, it belongs in a
larger and emerging academic conversation about both spirituality
and spiritual development.
There are possible beneﬁts to including spiritual health as part
of a holistic conceptualization of adolescent health and well-being.
Such thinking considers the health of children as dynamic and
integrated whole human beings as opposed to using a more
compartmentalized approach. In particular, this is consistent with
the teachings of many Indigenous cultures and also reﬂects a
growing body of contemporary research in more secular societies
that demonstrates the importance of spiritual health to adolescent
populations (King, Ramos, & Clardy, 2013; Roehlkepartain, King,
Wagener, & Benson, 2006). It is also in keeping with principles laid
out in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,
which outlines a child's right to a sense of spiritual well-being and
refers explicitly to these spiritual rights in four of its articles
(UNICEF, 1989). To illustrate, the Convention states that the child
“be given opportunities… to enable him [sic] to develop physically,
mentally, morally, spiritually and socially in a healthy and normal
manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity” (UNICEF, 1989).
Research in the ﬁeld of child spiritual health is challenged by
the multidisciplinary nature of the concept and the fact that there
are subtle differences in language and deﬁnitions applied across
disciplines, and approaches to presentation of ﬁndings. Child
spirituality has been referred to as a concept that can be “described but that is very difﬁcult to deﬁne” (Eaude, 2003). There is
some agreement that it involves some capacity for awareness of
the sacred qualities of life experiences, and that these are especially connected to being in relationship. This is typically expressed (as per our working deﬁnition) in the four relational domains.
This is in keeping with conceptual frameworks developed by
scholars including Fisher (2011) and Hay and Nye (1998).
In addition, it is important to distinguish between the concepts
of spirituality and religiosity. While religious traditions can
sometimes be vehicles for spiritual experience and growth, child
spirituality has been viewed as a more universal construct, one
that is not dependent on, or contained by, religious expression
(Crompton, 1999). Many studies on adult populations have
explored spirituality as separate from religiosity, and identify these
experiences as “spiritual-but-not-religious” (“SBNR”) (Schnell,
2012), “non-religious spirituality” (Jirásek, 2013; Hyland, Wheeler,
Kamble, & Masters, 2010), “atheistic spirituality” (Nolan, 2009),
and “humanist spirituality” (Kaufman, 1987). While this may also
be a common experience in child populations, because of some

295

natural overlaps between spirituality and religion, it is more difﬁcult for children—especially younger children who have not yet
developed the ability to think abstractly—to be able to clearly
distinguish spirituality and religiosity as separate concepts
(Crompton, 1999). Our study is based on the assumption that
while many children experience spirituality and religion in similar
contexts, children do not need to be religious in order to be
spiritual.
Spirituality-based practices provide one foundation for health
and its promotion (Lippman & Keith, 2006; Sallquist, Eisenberg,
French, Purwono, & Suryanti, 2010). In educational and clinical
settings, examples include interventions that focus on exposures
to nature (Louv, 2005; 2012), and techniques such as self-quieting
exercises and meditation and related mindfulness exercises
(Simkin & Black, 2014; Shonin, Van Gordon, & Grifﬁths, 2012).
Such practices are becoming common in many schools, hospitals,
and outpatient settings (Blaney & Smythe, 2014; Thompson &
Gauntlett-Gilbert, 2008). Engagement in spiritual health practices
has long been recognized in pastoral settings where care is provided for situations involving serious illness and death (Feudtner,
Haney, & Dimmers, 2003; Pendleton, Cavalli, Pargament, & Nasr,
2002). An emerging body of research now examines the merits of
spiritual health and care not only for young people in health crisis
and at end-of-life, but for those nearer to the beginning. This
contemporary surge in interest can perhaps be attributed to a
number of studies suggesting links between spirituality and
positive mental health (Eaude, 2009), happiness (Holder, Coleman,
& Wallace, 2008), and resilience among children (Smith, Webber,
& DeFrain, 2013).
More internationally, despite strong interest in spiritual health
as an important dimension of the health of children, as well as the
United Nations mandate to address such spiritual needs (UNICEF,
1989), the international research base in the peer-review domain
is limited, and there is a need for further evidence to understand
the views of younger children about their own spiritual health
(Benson et al., 2003; Houskamp, Fisher, & Stuber, 2004). Descriptions of developmental and gender-based patterns of spiritual
health across countries and cultures would be especially helpful as
much of the existing evidence is based on qualitative research
paradigms (e.g., Hay & Nye, 1998) or theoretical discussions (e.g.,
Eaude, 2009). Adolescence is a unique developmental phase, and is
distinct from childhood (Caskey & Anfara, 2007). Consequently,
intentional study of how adolescents perceive spirituality is worthy of consideration.
We had the opportunity to conduct a quantitative study of the
spiritual health of adolescents through our involvement in the
cross-national Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study, or
HBSC (Freeman et al., 2011). This longstanding study involves
researchers in some 43 countries or regions and seeks to understand adolescent health and its contextual determinants. In its
most recent cycle (2013–2014), a series of spiritual health measures were available to countries as a new optional set of items.
We used this opportunity in order to: (1) describe aspects of
perceptions of the importance of spiritual health of young people
by developmental stage within genders and across the six countries; (2) conduct similar analyses but within four speciﬁc domains
of spiritual health; (3) relate perceptions of the importance of
adolescent spiritual health to self-perceived personal health status. Our intentions were to explore the assessment of spiritual
health within a general adolescent health survey context, to
evaluate the consistency of suspected developmental and genderbased patterns of adolescent spiritual health experiences inferred
from existing theories (Fisher, 2011; Hay & Nye, 1998), and to
provide evidence that might inform the eventual planning and
targeting of spiritual health interventions applied to adolescents
within a diversity of health, educational and home settings.

Methods
Study populations and procedures
Countries involved in this cross-national study were as follows:
Canada, the Czech Republic, England, Israel, Poland and Scotland.
School-based anonymous surveys were conducted in each country
during the academic year 2013–2014 according to a common
research protocol (Currie et al., 2012). Our national research teams
surveyed students to produce representative national estimates
for 11–15 year-olds. Classes within schools were selected with
variations in sampling criteria permitted to ﬁt country-level circumstances. The samples included children across each year of this
age range, although in some countries the questions were only
asked of older age groups (ages 13–15 years). While some national
samples were developed to be self-weighting, in others (e.g.,
Canada), standardized weights were created to ensure representativeness. Country teams obtained approval to conduct the
survey from the ethics review board or equivalent regulatory body
associated with the institution conducting each respective
national survey. Participation was voluntary, and consent (explicit
or implicit) was sought from school administrators, parents, and
participating students as per national human subject requirements. At the student-participant level, response rates varied by
country and were 480% at the school level, and 470% at the
individual student level.
Measures
Adolescent spiritual health
The spiritual health module consisted of eight questions
adapted (for age-appropriate literacy and brevity) from Fisher's
Spiritual Well-being scale for secondary students (Gomez & Fisher,
2003). Two items were asked for each of the four standard
domains. Students responded to these questions with one of ﬁve
response categories ranging from 1—“not at all important” to 5
—“very important.” (N.B. response categories in Israel varied from
the standard protocol, and varied from 1—“not at all important” to
4—“very important”). The items asked students to identify at what
level they think it is important to: “feel that your life has meaning or
purpose”; “experience joy (pleasure, happiness) in life” (connections
to self); “be kind to other people”; “be forgiving of others” (connections to others); “feel connected to nature”; “care for the natural
environment” (connections to nature); “feel a connection to a higher
spiritual power”; “meditate or pray” (connections to the transcendent). A priori, our hope was that the eight items could be examined individually, by domain, and then potentially be combined
into a multidimensional scale. Use of an abbreviated (8-item)
version of a scale was dictated by our absolute requirement to
keep this instrument short and succinct, to minimize response
burden, especially in very young adolescents.
Reﬁnement of the spiritual health module for young adolescents
When the original version of this module was administered to a
young adult population, Cronbach's alpha values for the items
included in the four domains ranged from 0.72 to 0.86, with an
overall value of 0.78 (Wallace, 2010). When the scale in its original
form was ﬁrst introduced to HBSC, concerns expressed included its
length for inclusion on a general population health survey, and its
level of literacy for use with much younger adolescents (11 years).
This was conﬁrmed in initial focus group testing in Canada.
Therefore, in an adapted version of the module we retained the
8 items (2 per domain) with the highest factor loadings from the
Wallace (2010) study. We then tested this 8-item module both
quantitatively (n¼ 630) and qualitatively (n ¼21) in Scotland and
Canada (n ¼48) in 2013. A Cronbach's alpha value of 40.80 for the

eight items was found in initial reliability testing. This round of
focus group work suggested that two items were not clearly
understood by young people during these pilots, particularly in
very young adolescents. Hence, the items were re-worded based
upon the recommendations of these same young people, to
improve face validity.
We next went on to test this abbreviated and reﬁned version of
the module using the Canadian HBSC sample (n ¼ 25,567), considering solutions with up to four factors. Principal components
analyses involved oblimin rotation (which assumes correlation
between items). Findings best supported a four-factor structure
where the revised scale items loaded highly (each 40.80) and
according to the original four domains. This was further supported
by a maximum likelihood goodness of ﬁt test (p¼ 0.10) and
observed Cronbach's alpha values of 40.80 for each of the four
domains. Conﬁrmatory analyses too supported a four-factor solution with ﬁt statistics within acceptable ranges (RMSEA 0.06,
SRMR 0.02, AGFI 0.97). This supported the conduct of analyses
with the abbreviated 8-item scale but at the level of the four
original domains. However, based on the original theoretical
concept that would also support a composite measure of spiritual
health, we also combined the 8 items into a single multidimensional scale, for exploratory purposes only (N.B., please see
the discussion section surrounding our planned use of this scale,
moving forward).
General health status
Each respondent rated their personal health status: “Would you
say your health is?”: 1—“Excellent”; 2—“Good”; 3—“Fair”; 4—“Poor”.
Self-rated health measures represent relatively stable constructs
over repeated observations during adolescence, and when using
this measure, reported health deteriorates consistently with a lack
of general well-being, disability, healthcare attendance and healthcompromising behaviour, attesting to item validity (Idler &
Benyamini, 1997).
Demographic covariates
Based upon reported birth month and year and the date of
questionnaire administration, the age of each respondent was
estimated. Students also reported their gender (boy or girl), and
perceived socio-economic status (relative measure of material
wealth; how well off to you think your family is? (1—“Very well off”;
2—“Quite well off”; 3—“Average”; 4—Not very well off”; 5—“Not at all
well off”). Schools in each country were also numbered in
sequence so the effects of the clustered nature of data collection
(students nested within schools then countries) could be taken
into account in subsequent analyses.
Statistical analysis
Data analyses were conducted with SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC, 2013). Descriptive analyses were used to characterize the
samples in each country by age and gender. Composite scores for
the perceptions of the importance of spiritual health were estimated for each participant. Responses were divided into three
groups with cut-points anchored on the response totals, for
example with scores of 8–16 representing “not important” (scores
averaging 1–2 in the Likert Scale), 17–31 representing “somewhat
important (scores averaging 4 2 and o4 in the Likert Scale), and
32–40 representing “important” (scores average 4–5 on the Likert
scale). Percentages of children reporting the different levels of
scoring were then described by age and gender within each
country. Tests for statistical signiﬁcance in the linear trends in
these proportions were conducted using the Rao–Scott test that
accounted for clustering at the school level (Rao & Scott, 1981). We
tested for developmental patterns observed by age within genders,

V. Michaelson et al. / SSM -Population Health 2 (2016) 294–303

as well as differences in responses between the genders. We also
used a multivariable log-binomial regression, which accounted for
the nested data structure within each country (children nested
within schools) to model the developmental trends per two-year
age interval, and also relate the multidimensional spiritual health
score with self-perceived general health status. These models
mathematically adjusted for expected imbalances in basic sociodemographic factors that also relate to spiritual health (gender,
socio-economic status), based upon standard criteria for confounding (Rothman, Greenland, & Lash, 2008).

Results
Table 1 proﬁles the samples available for study. Some country
teams asked the spiritual health items of all HBSC ages, while
others limited their questioning to older age groups.
The perceptions of young people in terms of how often they
viewed each of the eight spiritual health items as “important” are
presented in Table 2. Across the six countries, declines in the
median proportions of young people reporting such perceptions of
importance were observed as children aged. This pattern was

observed consistently in both boys and in girls, but less consistently at the country level (N.B., in 3/6 countries; the Czech
Republic, Poland, and Scotland, these and subsequent age-related
trends were based upon responses from 13 to 15 year-olds, only).
Comparisons across the four domains suggest that “connections
with others” and “connections with self” were important to strong
majorities of young people, irrespective of their age or gender.
Similar declines in the perceived importance of the eight
spiritual health items were reﬂected in our multivariable logbinomial regressions, presented here per 2-year age interval
(Table 3). The largest declines were observed in the four items
describing the last two domains (connections with nature and to
the transcendent). There were also some apparent national and
perhaps cultural differences in responses observed across the
countries under study; for example Israel appeared to be anomalous to the other countries in the last two domains (N.B., this may
in part be attributable to its use of only 4 vs. 5 possible response
items, which varied from the other 5 countries).
Table 4 summarizes results according to the multidimensional
spiritual health score, presented here for exploratory purposes
only. These ﬁndings demonstrate strong and statistically signiﬁcant declines in the reported perceptions of spiritual health as
being “important” as children aged. Similar to the analyses at the
item and domain levels, this pattern was observed consistently by
gender within all countries, with the exception of girls from Israel.
In addition, in every age group and country, girls scored higher on
this composite score than did boys. Percentages of young people
within each age/gender grouping reporting the importance of
spiritual health to be in the “not important” range were small and
these values remained relatively consistent by age group.
Finally, Fig. 1 shows the proportion of respondents reporting
excellent self-perceived health status in relation to their overall
multidimensional spiritual health score. Relations were strong and
consistent among both boys and girls in each of the six countries.
Israel again stood out from all other countries because more young
people rated their health as excellent; however, the relationship
between the multidimensional spiritual health measure and selfperceived health status was consistent with that observed in other
countries.

Discussion
This cross-national study examined self-reported perceptions
of the importance of spiritual health in the lives of adolescent
children in six countries. We explored patterns of children's perceptions of the importance of spiritual health, overall and by

domain, related to developmental stage, gender, and country. We
accomplished this using an abbreviated measure that provides a
skeletal view of perceptions of the importance of spiritual health
to young people. We also explored relations between the importance of spiritual health measures and self-perceived personal
health status. In this discussion, we relate these quantitative
ﬁndings to existing theories that have been derived in mainly
qualitative studies (i.e. Hay & Nye, 1998).

Patterns by age and gender
Age-related declines in the rating of spiritual health as being
important were observed consistently across countries and by
gender. Several possible explanations exist for these declines. For
example, qualitative researchers Hay (anthropology) and Nye
(psychology) have argued that an inner sense of spiritual health is
innate to the biological make-up of children, and attributed
declines in spiritual health to the pervasive inﬂuence of society
and secular culture (Hay & Nye, 1998). Others explanations for
these declines may be related to natural changes in cognition and
to the emergence of independent thinking that comes with adolescent growth and development (Piaget, 1972; Butterworth &
Harris, 2014; Erikson, 1994). Cognitive changes that emerge with
age may enhance children's capacities for reason and abstract
thought. It is normal for young people to critically reassess concepts as they further become aware of the ideas behind them
(Piaget, 1972).
The observed gender-related ﬁndings were also striking. Relational aspects of spiritual health were generally rated as being
more important among girls than boys, irrespective of the age
group or country under study. These ﬁndings are consistent with
other studies (i.e. Benson, Scales, Syvertsen, & Roehlkepartain,
2012; Hendricks-Ferguson, 2006). Speculatively, this is likely
reﬂective of differences in the ways that girls and boys are nurtured during their early years and socialized as they enter
adolescence.

Patterns by domain
Connection with self
While the age-related declines and the gender-related disparities were observed in this domain, the vast majority of young
people from all demographic groups still rated the importance of
this domain highly. This ﬁnding might reﬂect the values of Euro
American societies that see subjective well-being and happiness as
individualistic (Luo Lu, 2004). It is also consistent with the idea
that personal meaning promotes both wellbeing and happiness in
children (Holder et al., 2008). This also connects with a growing
body of research that suggests that young people are eager to
search for purpose in their lives (Damon, Menon, & Bronk, 2003)
and to ask deep questions about ultimate concerns (King & Benson, 2006).
Connection with others
Among girls, this domain was somewhat anomalous to the ﬁrst
domain. While perceptions related to the question about forgiving
others followed the typical declining age-related pattern, those
related to the item asking about being kind to others did not.
Observed gender differences may reﬂect the ways that girls are
nurtured in the early years and then socialized as adolescents. This
response proﬁle is positive for the mental health of adolescent
girls in that expressions of kindness towards others as well practical acts of volunteering have both been linked to enhanced
happiness and well-being (Otake, Shimai, & Tanaka-Matsumi,
2006; Post, 2005). Others have shown the positive health beneﬁts
of forgiveness, including to one's physical, mental and emotional
health (Witvliet, Ludwig, & Vander Laan, 2001; Witvliet &
McCullough, 2007). The pattern in boys, however, demonstrated a
clear decline by age reﬂected in both questions.
Connection with nature
Findings associated with this domain were unexpected. The
consistent decline in this domain observed by age in boys and girls
alike contradicts assumptions that young people are likely to be
highly engaged with the environment, even though connections

with the natural world have long been held to have strong
importance to children (Louv, 2005, 2012). However, such connections may be overestimated for Northern European and North
American young people. Explanations for this are complex, but
may reﬂect distinctive changes among the current generation
in the nature of childhood and early adolescence, which is known
to feature less outdoor play (Gray, 2011) than previous
generations. This decline may be related to increased parental
concerns around crime and safety as well as to greater time
spent interacting with electronic communication technologies
(Clements, 2004).
Environmental issues may be regarded with less importance by
the groups of young people surveyed when compared with cultures with large populations of Aboriginal persons and adherents
to many Eastern religions (Fisher, Francis, & Johnson, 2000). School
curricula and social messages often present the environment as
being in crisis and in need of human care (i.e. Bigelow & Swineheart, 2014). Rather than experience the “awe and wonder” that
might be found in an experience of nature, young people may be
more likely to experience the stress connected with environmental degradation (Ojala, 2012, 2013).
Connection with the transcendent
The dominant perspective of an increasingly secular west has
been challenged by forms of religious resurgence in recent years
(Hughes, 2013); however, this does not appear to be central to

300

V. Michaelson et al. / SSM -Population Health 2 (2016) 294–303

adolescents in sampled countries (predominantly) from Christian
populations. The lower ratings of importance associated with this
domain of transcendence were not a surprise as this was the
domain that could perhaps be most closely linked to religious
experiences. It is also the most mysterious and abstract of the
domains. The observed pattern of moving from being “important”
to “somewhat important” suggests that children are not rejecting
their perceived experience of the importance of spirituality (or
potentially in this domain, of religion) completely as they get
older. Rather, declines are more likely attributable to external
inﬂuences and perhaps greater awareness of social expectations,
social norms, as well as cultural pressures that may devalue
spirituality or religion. And these too follow gender and agerelated patterns that are inﬂuenced by culture.
Regardless of its origins, a growing body of research demonstrates the deep importance of this transcendent domain, including asking questions about ultimate concerns in life, and expressions of spirituality are not necessarily bound to those experienced
in religious environments. Past research suggests that spirituality
is connected to happiness in young people (Holder et al., 2008).
Further, among those young people who do attend formal religious activities, social self-identiﬁcation with such communities
can be far more important than religious belief as “belonging
without necessarily believing” is a typical feature of adolescent
religious experiences (Francis & Robbins, 2004). These data do not
devalue the positive role that religion can potentially play in
facilitating positive spiritual health in young people, and indeed,
practices that have arisen from religious traditions also appear to
have practical value to health. For example, reﬂective practices
such as prayer (Levin, 1994) and mindfulness-based meditation,
which relates both to the domain connection to self and the
domain connection to the transcendent, (Biegel, Brown, Shapiro, &
Schubert, 2009) relate to many positive health outcomes, such as
the alleviation of stress (Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, & Walach,
2004). The small group of young people that still ﬁnd this connection to be important may receive health beneﬁts from these
priorities.
Israel
Results of the study showed cross-national differences, in particular with some notable differences in Israel, where adolescents
reported higher levels for most of the perceptions of spiritual
health items (experiencing joy, ﬁnding meaning, forgiving others,
a connection with a higher spiritual power and meditating/praying). In addition, in comparison to the other countries, levels of the
perceived importance of spiritual health did not decline over age
and gender differences were less notable. These results are in line
with past research with Jewish and Arab adolescents in Israel (Rich
& Cinamon, 2007) in which few gender differences were noted and
the vast majority of adolescents interviewed discussed a connection to a transcendental being (“something inﬁnitely greater than
themselves”). Israel, as a Jewish state with a large Arab minority, is
a country in which issues of identity (both religious and secularethnic) are paramount. Even among secular Jewish citizens, there
is a strong connection to a Jewish identity (CBS, 2009). Higher
levels of spirituality among Israeli adolescents may be explained
by the importance of ethnic identity (Phinney, 1990) throughout
the developmental task of adolescent identity formation in Israel.
In addition, deﬁnitions of spirituality emphasize a sense of connection to those outside of oneself. Due to its history and current
reality, Israel is a country in which many of its citizens feel a strong
sense of connection to the state, the community and other Israelis.
This feeling that one is part of a greater whole may increase or be
part of a sense of spirituality for young Israelis.

Potential inﬂuences on adolescent health
Overall, we observed that while the perceived importance of
spiritual health declines by age, for adolescents who maintain a
strong sense of the importance of self-perceived spiritual health
the possible beneﬁts are striking. This was indicated in our ﬁndings of self-perceived personal health status, which is a consistent
and powerful measure of many aspects of general well-being (Idler
& Benyamini, 1997). This relationship was observed consistently
across age, gender and countries (see Fig. 1), and while there
remains a great deal we do not understand about the etiology or
extent of this relationship, the strength and consistency suggests
that they merit serious attention. In a companion article, we
explore further the relationship between perceived importance of
spiritual health and a diversity of physical and emotional health
outcomes.
It is perhaps not surprising that the valuing of spiritual health is
positive to these health experiences. Past research has focused
more speciﬁcally on the health-related inﬂuences that relate to
aspects of the four domains. For example, connection to self
(Sinats et al., 2005); connection to peers (Scholte & Van Aken,
2006) and adults (Elgar, Trites, & Boyce, 2010); connection to
nature (Louv 2005, 2012) and a connection to the realm of
transcendence have all been demonstrated to have positive health
beneﬁts.

Strengths and limitations
Strengths of our study include our embedding of a (necessarily
abbreviated) spiritual health measure in a general adolescent
health survey, the size and diversity of the study populations and
their cross-national nature. While an emerging body of research
explores similar themes, including two studies that offer insight
on adolescent health and spiritual development in a multi-nation
sample that includes developing countries (see Benson et al., 2012;
Scales, Syvertsen, Benson, Roehlkepartain, & Sesma, 2014), our
study provides a helpful exploration of this topic within our more
general health survey context. We therefore feel that it is complimentary to the wider body of research in this ﬁeld, including
the original studies that led to existing theories of the inﬂuence of
child development on spiritual health (Hay & Nye, 1998). Our
ﬁndings strongly support the basic tenets of such theories but
provide further empirical evidence that demonstrates their universal nature.
Further limitations of our analysis include its cross-sectional
design, which makes it difﬁcult to attribute cause and effect.
Reverse causality in this situation is unlikely, however, given our
focus on demographic factors (age and gender) as the key independent variables. Second, due to the self-reported nature of our
study outcomes, it is possible that some misclassiﬁcation exists in
reports of the aspects of spiritual health that we have measured;
this misclassiﬁcation too may vary differentially by age group,
gender, and country and bias relationships in unknown directions.
Third, our analysis is intentionally descriptive, and we did not
make efforts to model and explain the mechanisms behind any
observed effects. Age and gender are proxy measures for deeper
constructs, with further study warranted to truly understand the
developmental and gender-based patterns. Our analysis represents
the perceptions of young people from a few countries and such
ﬁndings may not be generalizable to other contexts and cultures.
One potential criticism of this multidimensional scale that
measures perceptions of child spiritual health is that it is operationally very similar to other psychological constructs. The latter
include measures of well-being, life satisfaction, and emotional
health. These constructs too have some emphasis on connections

V. Michaelson et al. / SSM -Population Health 2 (2016) 294–303

and relationships, and hence would correlate with this multidimensional measure of adolescent perceptions of spiritual health.
Analyses of such correlations may be problematic due to these
conceptual overlaps. Further, our measures of perceptions of
spiritual health attempt to get at inner experiences and feelings
(subjective perceptions of importance) vs. reports of actual spiritual health practices. Such perceptions are clearly not identical to
the lived experience of spiritual health. Further study, both qualitative and quantitative, about such lived experiences would be a
positive contribution to this area of research.
Finally, the 8-item version of the spiritual health module used
admittedly represents only a skeletal view of this construct and its
four domains. It was not possible to include the full 20-item
Fisher's Spiritual Well-being scale for secondary students (Gomez
& Fisher, 2003) due to questionnaire response burden in our
general health survey context. While extensive efforts were made
to validate the abbreviated version and most psychometrics
associated with its use were satisfactory, our conﬁrmatory analysis
suggests that use of the 8-item version is not optimal, and future
work should revert, where possible, to use of the 20-item scale.

Implications
The highly gendered patterns in these self-reported perceptions of the importance of spiritual health, which generally favour
girls over boys, suggest that gender-speciﬁc curricula and
approaches to the promotion of spiritual health may be warranted.
In addition, wide variations in the perceived importance of spiritual health exist by domain, and the strong declines observed with
age for some key domains suggest a need for a more outward
focus to be stressed during adolescence. For example, if spirituality
enhances health by increasing personal meaning, strategies aimed
at enhancing personal meaning in children's lives require promotion. Approaches could include such simple things as
encouraging young people to keep journals (Sinats et al., 2005) or
to participate in volunteer activities (Holder et al., 2008; Post,
2005). While evidence surrounding their effects is mixed, meditation programs such as mindfulness also appear to be efﬁcacious.
Provision of opportunities for young people to not only care for,
but also to learn to know and love the natural world, may also be
important.
In order for such interventions to be fully informed, there is a
need for more in-depth explorations of the mechanisms that lay
behind the observed patterns. There is a further need for conceptual work on differences between religiosity and spirituality (as
begun by Benson et al. (2012) and Scales et al. (2014)) and a
stronger conceptualization of the meaning and assessment of
spiritual health in child populations, building on the work of
scholars such as Fisher (1999, 2010, 2011). More theoretically,
questions remain surrounding the societal and personal mechanisms that underlie the decline by age that has been observed in
this study, and in particular, if this decline is related to increased
exposure to secular aspects of Western culture as children age.
Further study of interrelationships between all four domains and
whether or not each is equally important to children is also warranted (Fisher, 2011). Finally, efforts are needed to describe spiritual health as a protective asset for speciﬁc health outcomes in
various contexts and cultures.

Conclusion
Adolescence represents a key time of transition that requires
ongoing focus as children learn, grow, and develop cognitively and
socially through their formative years. Study ﬁndings conﬁrm

301

developmental theories that suggest that the importance of
spiritual health, overall and by domain, declines as children grow
and develop. Our analysis of the perceptions of young people in
6 countries provides further evidence to this ﬁeld of study. From
the standpoint of health promotion, optimization of spiritual
health may be one important way that overall health status can be
gained as it may be a positive health asset for young people. There
is an inherent elusive quality to spirituality, and so to spiritual
health. While we cannot claim to capture the whole of a person's
spiritual health, this study offers us clues and markers as to how
the aspects of “connectedness” among these four domains, which
are recognized elements of spiritual health, contribute to the
overall health of a child. We reiterate that future work is needed in
order to capture a broader picture of spiritual health in adolescent
populations, including, where possible, use of Gomez and Fisher's
full scale (Gomez & Fisher, 2003) versus our 8-item adapted version. Goals of future work could also include moving beyond
capturing perceptions of the importance of spiritual health to
exploring children's lived experiences within each domain. This
analysis provides a starting point for etiological research and the
development and targeting of health interventions, whether they
are in educational, hospital, home or pastoral care settings.
