Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

ABSTRACT:
Purpose: We evaluated the relationship between dietary fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake, and the risk

RI
PT

of kidney stone formation.
Methods: Overall, 83,922 postmenopausal women from the WHI Observational Study were included
and followed prospectively. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses evaluated the associations

SC

between total dietary fiber, fruits, and vegetable intake, and the risk of incident kidney stone formation
adjusting for nephrolithiasis risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, geographic region, diabetes mellitus,

calcium supplementation, hormone therapy use, body mass index, calibrated caloric intake, and
dietary water, sodium, animal protein, and calcium intake). Women with a prior history of kidney
stones (3,471 women) were analyzed separately.

Results: Mean age was 64±7 years, 85% of women were Caucasian and 2,937 women (3.5%)

TE
D

experienced a kidney stone occurrence in 8 years median follow-up. In women with no history of
kidney stones, higher total dietary fiber (6-26% decreased risk, p<0.001), higher fruit intake (12-25%
decreased risk, p<0.001), and higher vegetable intake (9-22% decreased risk, p=0.002) were

EP

associated with a decreased risk of incident kidney stone formation in separate adjusted models. In
women with a history of stones, there were no significant protective effects of fiber, fruits, or

AC
C

vegetable intake on the risk of kidney stone recurrence.
Conclusions: Greater dietary intake of fiber, fruits and vegetables were each associated with a
reduced risk of incident kidney stones in postmenopausal women. The protective effects were
independent of other known risk factors for kidney stones. In contrast, there was no reduction in risk
in women with a history of stones.

Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

INTRODUCTION

RI
PT

Kidney stone prevalence has increased by almost 70% over the last 15 years.1
Recommending increased fluid intake, low sodium, low animal-protein and normal calcium intake
diets have been the mainstays of prevention of kidney stone recurrence.2-4 The identification of

SC

additional dietary factors that are associated with the risk of stone formation would be clinically
beneficial.

M
AN
U

Previous studies have noted that diets with higher fruit and vegetable intake might be
associated with lower risk of urinary stones.2, 5 Both fruits and vegetables provide an alkali load that
could increase urinary citrate, a known inhibitor of stone formation.6-9 Dietary phytate, the most
abundant form of phosphate in plants, forms insoluble complexes with calcium in the intestinal tract,
inhibits crystal formation in the urine, and is associated with reduced risk of stones.10-12 Greater fruit

TE
D

and vegetable intake might decrease the intake of dietary sodium, animal protein, and total calories.2Despite these potential benefits, there is some concern that greater intake of some vegetables

(spinach, swiss chard, beets, and rhubarb for example) might increase the risk of stone formation as

EP

they are known to be rich in oxalate.

AC
C

Total dietary fiber may also impact stone formation as it contains nondigestible compounds
including lignin and nonstarch polysaccharies, which might bind to minerals and fat in the gut leading
to reduced urinary excretion of oxalate and calcium.10, 12 However, prior studies have shown mixed
results on urinary calcium excretion,13-16 and thus the association between fiber intake and stone
formation is unclear.13, 14, 17
The purpose of this study was primarily to evaluate the relationship between dietary fiber, fruit,
and vegetable intake and the risk of incident kidney stone formation in women with no history of

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT

stones and secondarily, to evaluate these relationships on stone recurrence in women with a history
of kidney stones.

METHODS:
Participants

SC

The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study is a prospective, longitudinal,
multicenter study investigating the health of postmenopausal women.18, 19 Overall, 93,676 women,

U

age 50-79, enrolled from 1993 to 1998 and were followed for a median of 8 years. Participants
completed health history questionnaires at enrollment and annually throughout participation, which
included self-reported history and occurrences of incident stones. A WHI food frequency
questionnaire (FFQ) was administered at enrollment.20 Women who never answered the incident

kidney stone questions, women who did not complete the FFQ, and those reporting extremes of
energy intake (<600 or >5000 kcalories per day as categorized by WHI) were excluded from these
analyses (7,912 total women).20 We also excluded 1,842 women who were missing their kidney

stone history at baseline, leaving a final analytic cohort of 83,922 women. Included in this cohort
were 3,471 women with a history of kidney stones prior to enrollment. These participants were

considered a separate group for all analyses.

Our primary aim was to evaluate the association between fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake and
kidney stone events during the study period. Daily dietary energy and nutrient intake was determined
using the WHI FFQ administered at the baseline enrollment evaluation targeting intake in the
previous 3 months (University of Minnesota Nutrient Data System for Research, Minneapolis, MN).20

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

Women were asked how often they ate 36 different fruits and 66 vegetables (never, monthly, 2-3
times per month, weekly, 2 times per week, 3-4 times per week, 5-6 times per week, daily or 2+ times
per day), and the size of their serving. They were provided a reference for a medium portion for each

RI
PT

fruit and vegetable (i.e. one medium banana, ½ cup potatoes). Daily fiber (g/day), fruit (medium
portions), and vegetable intake (medium portions) were calculated from the FFQ and categorized into
quintiles of intake. Dietary energy intake (kcalories per day) was analyzed as a continuous variable

SC

after calibration was performed to correct some of the bias associated with self-reported intake,21, 22
as previously described.23, 24 Boot-strapping (500 samples) generated 95% confidence intervals for

all analyses including calibrated energy intake to accounting for the sample variation in calibration
coefficient estimates.

Anthropometric variables including body weight and height were measured at the clinic by study
staff. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated (kg/m2) and analyzed categorically (<18.5, 18.5-24.9,

TE
D

25-29.9, 30-34.9, ≥35 kg/m2)25 as a non-linear effect of BMI on stone risk was anticipated. Age was
analyzed as a continuous variable. Baseline history of diabetes mellitus, calcium supplementation,
hormone therapy (none, prior, current), and geographic region (Northeast, South, Midwest, West)

EP

were analyzed categorically. Dietary water, salt, animal protein and calcium were categorized into
quintiles. Dietary calcium intake and calcium supplementation were included as separate variables

due to the perceived differential effect on the risk of stone formation.

The primary outcome of interest was incident kidney stone occurrence during follow-up. For all
comparisons, analyses were stratified by history of kidney stones prior to WHI study participation.
Wilcoxon Rank-Sum was used to compare median follow-up. Women were followed until the date of
the stone event or were censored at last follow-up or death. Cox proportional hazards regression

analyses were used to compare categorical and continuous variables. Cox proportional hazards
regression was also used in each of the three multivariate models to evaluate the association
between primary variables of interest (fiber, fruit, and vegetable intakes) and kidney stone event.

Each of the models was adjusted for nephrolithiasis risk factors (age, race/ethnicity, geographic
region, diabetes mellitus, baseline calcium supplementation, hormone therapy use, calibrated dietary
energy intake, dietary intake of water, sodium, animal protein and calcium).24, 26 A correlation matrix

evaluated the potential co-linearity of fiber, fruit and vegetable intake.

Hazard ratios (HR), adjusted hazard ratios (aHR), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were

determined. All p-values were two–tailed, and statistical significance was set at p<0.05. Analyses
were performed using Stata IC v10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).

A final exploratory analysis was performed that included quintiles of fiber, fruits, and vegetable

intake (all three variables) in an attempt to determine if one of these variables was more strongly
associated with kidney stone formation. To test for interaction, additional regression models were
performed which included the product of the fiber*fruit, fiber*vegetable, and fruit*vegetable intake

RESULTS:
Women in our study population had a mean age of 64±7 years at enrollment, 85% were White,
and most women were normal weight or overweight. Hormone therapy use was common (60%).
Most women had moderate daily intake of fiber, fruits, and vegetables. After a median follow-up of 8

years, there were 2,937 stone events reported, including 2,390 incident stone events in 583,464
person-years follow-up (4 events per 1000 person years) and 547 recurrent stone events in 24,958
person-years follow-up (21 events per 1000 person years). Women with a history of kidney stones

RI
PT

were statistically different from women with no history of stones in terms of age, race, medical
history, calcium supplementation, hormone therapy use, BMI, and geographic region (Table 1). Only
3% of the women with no history of stones developed a stone during the study, while more than 15%

SC

of women with a history of stones reported an event during the study (p<0.001). Women with a
history of kidney stones had lower mean intake of fiber, fruit, and vegetables, with the greatest

M
AN
U

proportion of women in the lowest, and second lowest quintiles of intake (all p<0.001).
In unadjusted analyses, fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake were each associated with a
significant decreased risk of stone formation in women with no history of kidney stones (Table 2). In
contrast, women with a history of kidney stones did not demonstrate a significant relationship

TE
D

between fiber (p=0.24) or fruit (p=0.23) intake and kidney stone occurrence, but had a borderline
association with vegetable intake (p=0.08), especially at the highest two quintiles of intake.
In multivariate analyses, women with no history of stones with the highest dietary fiber intake

EP

were 22% less likely (aHR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67-0.92, p trend < 0.001) to report an incident stone event

AC
C

during the study compared to women with the lowest fiber intake (Table 3). In a separate model,
women with the highest fruit intake were 15% less likely (aHR 0.85, 95%CI 0.74-0.98, p trend <
0.001) to report an incident stone event compared to women with the lowest fruit intake. In a third
model, women with the highest vegetable intake were 22% less likely (aHR 0.78, 95%CI 0.68-0.91, p
trend = 0.002) to report an incident stone event compared to women with the lowest vegetable intake.
Women with a history of kidney stones prior to study participation did not demonstrate a significant
relationship between fiber (p=0.93), fruit (p=0.73), or vegetable intake (p=0.50) and kidney stone
occurrence during the study. There was moderate correlation between fiber and vegetable intake

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

(r=0.62), and fiber and fruit intake (r=0.59), with less correlation between fruit and vegetable intake
(r=0.41).
In the exploratory adjusted model that included fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake, there was a

RI
PT

trend towards higher fiber intake being associated with up to a 16% decreased risk of incident stones
(p=0.053) in women with no history of stones. Higher fruit intake was associated with a 4-18%
decreased risk of incident stones (p=0.04) in women with no history of stones. Vegetable intake did

SC

not significantly decrease the risk of a stone occurrence (p=0.20). Also, there was no significant
interaction between fiber and fruit (p=0.92), fruit and vegetable (p=0.35) or fiber and vegetable

AN
U

(p=0.99) intake. In women with a history of stones prior to study participation, fiber, fruit, and
vegetable intake were not associated (p=0.90, p=0.80, p=0.48, respectively) with a stone occurrence

TE
D

and there was no significant interaction between these variables in this model.

DISCUSSION:

This study demonstrated that women with the highest quintile intake of fiber, fruit, and

EP

vegetables were 22%, 15%, and 22% less likely to report an incident stone event, respectively,
compared to women with the lowest quintile intake for postmenopausal women with no history of

AC
C

stones in adjusted analyses. This represents a difference of about 2 portions per day of fruits and
vegetables, or an increase of 12 grams per day of fiber intake between the lowest and highest
quintiles of intake. The effects of fiber, fruit and vegetable intake on stone risk appear to be
independent from the traditional dietary risk factors including calories, fluid, sodium, animal protein
and calcium intake. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables has previously been shown to increase
urine volume, pH, potassium, magnesium, citrate, phytate and other stone inhibitors, resulting in a
decrease in the supersaturation of calcium oxalate and uric acid.6 It is also possible that women with

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

the highest intake of fruits, vegetables and other fiber containing foods are making other healthy
dietary choices, or perhaps avoiding foods that may increase the risk of stone formation.
However, this relationship did not exist in adjusted analyses for women with a history of kidney

RI
PT

stones. The etiology of this differential effect is not entirely clear. The average consumption of fruits,
vegetables and fiber were each lower in women with a history of stones, with the greatest proportion
of women falling in the lowest intake categories. It is also possible that the intake of fiber, fruits, and

SC

vegetables are important in initial stone formation, but may be less important for recurrence in the
face of other stronger risk factors for stone formation such as BMI, and the intake of fluids, sodium,

M
AN
U

animal protein and calcium. The nuances of which vegetables are high in oxalate can be confusing,
and information from medical providers or internet sources are often incomplete, and thus patients
may be globally reducing vegetable intake in an attempt to reduce their oxalate intake.27
Reassuringly, this study specifically found no increased risk of stone formation with higher vegetable

TE
D

intake. Previous studies of fiber, fruit and vegetable intake have been mixed,5, 6, 9, 11-17 possibly in
part due to a failure to stratify based on stone history.
Our findings suggest that there may be a fundamental difference between women who formed

EP

their first stone during this study and those who formed a recurrent stone during this study. Only 3%
of women with no history of stones had an occurrence, compared to over 15% of women with a

AC
C

history of stones. Thus, a woman who has her first kidney stone sometime in her 60s, might be
phenotypically different compared to a woman with a history of stones earlier in life. Women with a
history of stones might be more likely to have a rare disorder related to stone formation (renal
tubular acidosis, primary hyperparathyroidism, gouty diathesis, sarcoidosis, etc), or perhaps
behavior and diet are greater contributors to stone formation for the woman having her first stone
later in life.
Although greater intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber was not associated with a protective
effect in our recurrent stone formers, these findings should not discourage providers from supporting

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT
Fiber, Fruit, and Vegetable Intake and the Risk of Incident Kidney Stones

greater intake. These foods remain an important foundation of a healthy diet and are important for
overall health with benefits beyond stone risk reduction. Greater intake of fruits, vegetables, and fiber
likely contributes to decreased intake of foods that are high in calories, sodium, fat, and animal

RI
PT

protein. Importantly, subjects with a history of stones may not have had a decrease in stone
formation, but those with the greatest vegetable intake did not appear to incur any additional risk.
This study has several limitations. WHI only includes postmenopausal women and may not be

SC

generalizable to others including younger women or men. The measurement of fruit, vegetable, and
fiber intake relied on food frequency questionnaire and may be subject to recall bias and thus

M
AN
U

provides an estimate of intake, while true intake might be different. It is also possible that some of the
intake is in the form of high-oxalate containing foods which may offset some of the protective
association demonstrated in this study. Water and sodium intake are likely underestimated as the
values are calculated based on the total beverage and food content of these factors, but do not

TE
D

include additional quantities added in preparation or consumed at the table. Self-reported caloric
intake is often unreliable and it is possible that our calibration may have only corrected some of the
associated bias.21-23 Stone type and 24-hour urine composition were also not known. Stone events

EP

for women in the WHI is higher than prior population-based reports, potentially due to
increased rates of imaging detection of asymptomatic stones.24 Stone events were not

AC
C

adjudicated in our study, though self-reported stone events have previously been determined
to be 97-98% accurate.28, 29

CONCLUSIONS:
Higher intake of fruits, vegetables and fiber are associated with a decreased risk of incident
kidney stone formation in postmenopausal women, independent of the effect of BMI and other
nephrolithiasis risk factors including dietary intake of water, sodium, animal protein and calcium. This
