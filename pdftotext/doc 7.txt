Summary The active involvement of consumers in the education of nurses and other health
professionals has been acknowledged as essential if Australian mental health policy goals to
enhance consumer participation in all aspects of mental health services are to be realised.
However, consumer participation has not become embedded in nurse education. A qualitative
exploratory study was undertaken to gain perspectives from mental health nurse academics
and consumer educators and academics. Telephone interviews were conducted with 34 nurse

academics and 12 consumer academics or educators. Data were analysed thematically. Two important themes to emerge from this work were: vision for the future; and building capacity. Most
participants highly valued the contribution consumers made to the education process and had
a desire to see this strengthen. A stronger vision was evident from consumer participants who
sought expansion into all health professions and a more deﬁned process for communication and
collegiality between consumer academics and educators. Closely tied to vision, was the issue
of capacity building, and the need to provide supports to consumers as these are currently not
readily available. Closer collaboration between nurses and consumers is necessary to ensure consumer participation is genuine and effective and promotes the development and articulation of
their expertise and contribution to education.

1. Introduction
Involving consumers as genuine and active participants in
the education of health professionals is not a new concept. In Australia, in the late 1990s Deakin University
led the development of ‘‘Learning Together’’ including a
framework for future discussion and debate on how to
increase and sustain consumer involvement in the education
of health professionals (Deakin University Human Services,
1999). Consumer participation was found to be ad hoc,
infrequent, and limited in scope (Deakin University Human
Services, 1999). In the absence of a clear framework or
guidelines for future consumer involvement in curriculum
design, the intended beneﬁts of consumer focused care and
cultural change in mental health services were unlikely to
be achieved.
The need for consumers to play a central role in
the education of health professionals is emphasised in
the ﬁrst version of the National Practice Standards for
the Mental Health Workforce (Commonwealth of Australia,
2002):
Of key importance is the premise that any health
professional entering the mental health workforce, or
completing undergraduate or postgraduate mental health
courses, should have the opportunity to be educated by
mental health consumers, their family members and carers about their:
• ‘Lived’ experiences of mental illness.
• Requirements for adequate services and support.
• Ability to work in partnership with mental health professionals (p. viii).
Involving consumers in the education of health professionals has been recognised with the potential to positively
inﬂuence the attitudes of health professionals to people
with mental illness (Babu, Law-Win, Adlam, & Banks, 2008;
Linden & Kavanagh, 2012; Repper & Breeze, 2007; Ross
& Goldner, 2009; Terry, 2012). This inﬂuence is crucial
in addressing the stigmatising and discriminatory attitudes frequently displayed by health professionals (Hansson,
Jormfeldt, Svedberg, & Svensson, 2013; Linden & Kavanagh,
2012; Mårtensson, Jacobsson, & Engström, 2014; Ross &
Goldner, 2009). Meeting the aspirations for recovery-focused
mental health services requires a movement away from the
dominance of psychiatry and the medical model approach to

treatment towards the focus on subjective well-being and
recovery that developed from the consumer movement and
the belief that mental illness was not necessarily life-long
and persistent (Anthony, 1993; Davidson & Roe, 2007; Slade,
2009).
An audit of consumer involvement in nursing programs undertaken by the mental health nurse education
taskforce (MHNET) identiﬁed increase in participation
since the Deakin project. However, the inclusion of consumers remained limited, variable and ad hoc. (McCann,
Moxham, Usher, Crookes, & Farrell, 2009). A more signiﬁcant increase in consumer participation was reported
in a recent survey. Approximately 75% of undergraduate
nursing and postgraduate mental health nursing programs
were found to include consumer participation in some
capacity (Happell, Platania-Phung et al., 2015). However,
in the majority of cases this involved one or a small
number of consumers involved in face to face teaching of between 1 and 4 h duration. There were few
exemplars of consumers having active and genuine involvement in curriculum development, assessment and program
evaluation. Two full time and one part time consumer academic positions have been implemented at two Australian
universities.
The ﬁrst known consumer academic position commenced
in 2000 (Happell & Roper, 2002), with a positive evaluation (Happell, Pinikahana, & Roper, 2003; Happell & Roper,
2003). Similar positions were subsequently developed in New
Zealand (Schneebeli, O’Brien, Lampshire, & Hamer, 2010)
and the United Kingdom (Simons et al., 2007) and were evaluated positively by academic staff and nursing students.
However, positions of this kind have failed to proliferate.
With limited consumer involvement in most instances, the
impact is unlikely to reach the visionary goals that underpin
this approach to education.
A systematic review of the literature supports the view
that consumer participation remains minimal and ad hoc
internationally and across the disciplines (Happell et al.,
2014; Perry, Watkins, Gilbert, & Rawlinson, 2013; Terry,
2012; Townend, Tew, Grant, & Repper, 2008). Tokenism has
been an unfortunate consequence (Forrest, Risk, Masters,
& Brown, 2000; Hossack & Wall, 2005; Meehan & Glover,
2007), with consumers frequently asked to tell their story
of diagnosis and mental health service use, regardless of
whether they feel this is the most appropriate way to
educate students. Their capacity to inﬂuence the broader
curriculum and mental health service culture and to

Consumer involvement in nursing education
teach their speciﬁc content and expertise often remains
limited.
To enhance understanding of consumer participation
in the education of nurses in Australia, an exploratory
research study was undertaken with nurses and consumers
involved in mental health nursing, to enable this ﬁrsthand experience to contribute to the future agenda. Vision
for the future and capacity building are two themes to
emerge from this work, and are the primary focus of this
paper.

2. Methods
2.1. Approach
This research was conducted in 2013 using a qualitative
exploratory approach based on the work of Stebbens (2001).
This approach is recognised as particularly relevant and
appropriate where there is a paucity of research evident, necessary to underpin and guide other methodological
approaches. A qualitative exploratory approach provides
the environment for participants who have knowledge and
expertise speciﬁcally related to the topic in question and are
able to inform the research by sharing their perceptions and
experiences.

2.2. Setting and sample
This was a national based Australian study of nurse academics at universities teaching nursing at pre-registration
and/or post-registration level. Thirty-four of the 38
Australian universities educating nurses participated
in the study. There were two participants from some
universities running both pre-registration and postregistration programs. Currently postgraduate specialist
mental health nursing qualiﬁcations are not mandatory
for practice in these settings, however for those nurses
seeking formal recognition as a Mental Health Nurse
(though credentialing by the Australian College of Mental
Health Nurses), the postgraduate diploma is the minimum requirement to be recognised by the Australian
College of Mental Health Nursing (Deacon & Cleary,
2013).
Participants included nurses and consumers with
expertise in delivering or supporting the use of consumer perspectives within the teaching of nursing.
Consumer participants had a range of different levels
and types of involvement in the education of nurses
within the university system. A total of 12 consumers
participated, including those employed casually (n = 9)
and those holding a designated academic position
(n = 3).

2.3. Recruitment
2.3.1. Nurses
An email was sent to Heads of Schools of Nursing in Australia
informing them of the study and inviting them to participate. Those schools who agreed to participate were asked
to provide the names and contact details for the coordinator of mental health nursing studies at undergraduate and
postgraduate level. The mental health nursing staff were
sent a copy of the plain language statement and consent
form by email, once their details were received. Telephone

3
interviews were subsequently arranged with those willing
to be involved.
2.3.2. Consumers
The process for identifying consumer participants was more
difﬁcult and mental health nurse participants were asked to
inform consumers who worked with them about the study
and invite them to participate. The names and contact
details of those who consented to being involved were then
sent to the research team. Contact was then made, with
consumers and they were sent an information sheet and
given time to answer any questions they had. Telephone
interviews were then arranged at a mutually convenient
time.

2.4. Procedure
Interviews were conducted by telephone with participants
in all states and territories of Australia as face to face
interviews were physically and ﬁnancially impossible. With
consent of participants interviews were audio-recorded.
Two research assistants conducted the interviews. A mental health nurse with signiﬁcant experience in research
roles conducted the nurse interviews. A very experienced
researcher who identiﬁed as and has worked extensively
from a consumer perspective, conducted the interviews with
consumer participants.

2.5. Ethical issues
Prior to commencement of the research, ethics approval
was granted from the university committees representing
the research team. Participants were advised that participation was voluntary and they retained the right not to
participate or to withdraw consent at any stage. Conﬁdentiality was guaranteed and participant numbers were used
in place of names: NP (nurse participant) and CP (Consumer
participant).

2.6. Data analysis
The verbatim transcripts of interviews were analysed thematically. This commenced with all transcripts being read
and re-read to enable the team to become familiar with the
data, leading to the development of themes and subthemes.
A conceptual map of the identiﬁed themes was drawn and
selected quotes representing main ideas were recorded. At
this stage the data were analysed in detail for comprehension, synthesis, theorising and contextualising. A draft of
themes and sub-themes was extensively examined by the
team and negotiations were undertaken until agreement
was obtained. Vision for the future and capacity building
were two main themes and are the primary focus of this
paper.

3. Findings
3.1. Vision for the future
3.1.1. Consumers
Participants contributed a plethora of ideas about how
consumer involvement in the education ofnurses could be

strengthened. Validation for consumer knowledge to be
regarded as legitimate and essential in its own right, rather
than as an adjunct to conventional course content was one
participant’s vision:

The vision for the future was not limited to teaching mental health nurses. Participants were keen to see a stronger
vision of including consumers into all health professional
education:

My vision is where the mental health nurses and the
consumer advocate, or the consumer educators have an
equal standing. So the consumer educator advice and
knowledge is just as valid as what it says in DSM-4, or
I think it’s the DSM-5 now (CP 10).

I’d like to see this across all disciplines at all the universities, and all the courses. I think it’s really, really
important. . . (CP 8)

Similarly, another participant described a vision of having
consumers and nurses working together in education settings
with consumers describing the lived experience of various
mental illness diagnoses, for example:
. . . some joint sessions with a clinician and a consumer,
talking about how the partnership works . . . about how
they work well together in that clinical relationship. . .
it’s not really talked about anywhere else . . . if they’re
going to talk about the different mental health problems,
to have somebody living with each of the mental health
problems to come in and talk about that lived experience
(CP 8).
Some participants described their desire to have a
greater understanding of the curriculum as a whole, to
enhance understanding of how the consumer component
contributes to the bigger picture:
I’d like to know a bit more about what . . . else they do
in their course because I feel as if I — I’m just . . . an
interruption to their course — — — (CP 3)
Likewise, a full time consumer academic reﬂecting on
her own experience of commencing in the role believed it
would be beneﬁcial to have a greater understanding of the
broader curriculum and other characteristics of the university environment in the early stages:
. . . an orientation to the mental health team and where
the [university’s] goals . . . and visions are . . . So a real orientation into the culture and vision that’s existing, rather
than picking it up bit by bit. Just having that opportunity
for someone to sit with you for half a day . . . and say, this
is what we do here, this is who the players are, this is the
type of research we focus on, these are areas we’d like to
break into, these are our key opportunities and strengths,
these are our areas of weakness that we probably need
to grow in (CP 9).
Participants also sought an expansion of roles in education extending beyond telling their story and other forms of
teaching, to a more active involvement in the design and
assessment of courses:
I want them [consumers] involved in the curriculum
design, in designing the assessment. I want to see consumers leading research around what works and showing
the differences . . . We have research that comes from
drug companies’ money that says that the medications
that people are taking are effective. I’d like to see
research that would either support or refute that . . .
come and driven from consumers . . . And I’d like to see,
as is happening in your work [work of the consumer interviewer] that recovery is really taught by people who have
that lived experience, who are the people who really
know that stuff, and not by others . . . (CP 4)

3.1.2. Nurses
The majority of participants did not have consumer academics on staff and when questioned about their vision for
the future of consumers in mental health nursing education
they were very positive about the concept.
That’s part of social justice, introducing mental health
nursing with a consumer perspective (NP12);
We really need to be having more consumer
involvement—from the ground up, in terms of both
research and education (NP34).
In keeping with consumers’ views of expanding the consumer role within the university, the following participant
added:
I would like to see is a more formalised input of consumers
into curriculum delivery and key learnings and to teaching
and assessments (NP15).
The proposed scope for consumer involvement in the
future was highlighted by another participant:
We hope to have consumers involved in writing up the
labs, involved in labs and debrieﬁng, so enriching every
part of the curriculum (NP18).
Enthusiasm for a consumer academic role to enhance
teaching and learning was obvious from the following conversation:
It’s how we [could] get messages across, how we [would]
choose resources, how we [would] choose to evaluate,
and then [be] teaching alongside; discussing in a very
robust, dynamic way how we might use the skills of the
academic and the consumer together (NP21).

3.2. Building capacity
3.2.1. Consumers
The vision consumer participants held for future roles in the
education of nurses and other health professionals was discussed in the broader issue of capacity building. There was
a strong desire for capacity building in the future with the
opportunity for collegiality and peer learning, rather than
consumers working in solo roles as tends to be the case
currently:
. . . every single discipline ought to have access to a consumer teacher. Not a consumer teacher either but two or
more consumer educators able to be known to each other
as a group who can sustain each other . . .. Just having
come from the service users academic conference . . . it
was a real strong sense that there was a real energising
of what was possible and that happens so easily just with
that contact (CP 6)
The experience of most participants had been in isolated
roles with little if any opportunity for collegial exchange and
peer support and interaction, for example one participant
advocated:

Consumer involvement in nursing education
Linking consumers to each other to do this type of work,
‘cause it can be very isolating and you don’t know what
other people have done . . . if you’re not linked into others
. . . you’ve got to start from scratch . . . I’d like to see
strategies where consumers could be linked together, or
at least have a sense of what others are doing in the work
. . . not ﬁnd out just by chance that somebody else is doing
something (CP 4).
Through networking, participants identiﬁed the opportunity to increase their access to resources, learn from
others experience and the potential to produce materials
that would enable the consumer content to be supported
by relevant and appropriate materials, rather than trying to
work around the health professional literature:
Communication strategies would be good, so that there’s
consistent people walking the talk. The reason we have
people with lived experience is to have that integrity of
recovery, yet we’re still drawing on a lot of texts and
everything which come completely from a clinical perspective (CP 9)
The limited number of people able to undertake consumer participation combined with the lack of investment
in them and the resources to support them was identiﬁed as
a problem in enabling genuine and meaningful contribution
as partners rather than contributors:
. . .there’s not enough of us but no one’s actually prepared
to put the resources in and stop extracting our grey matter for their stuff . . . we’re in more demand . . . but I still
believe that the resources haven’t been put into developing — giving us paid time so that our thinking is respected
and we’ve got time to develop it with each other and to
be brought in at that point where things are being thought
about, not at the end when bits of our grey matter have
been extracted (CP 6).

3.3. Nurses
Nurse participants did not speciﬁcally describe the need for
capacity building, however they did refer to the limited
availability of experienced consumer educators or academics with both the skills and the availability required to
contribute to the education of nurses:
Our experience is that the consumers that are conﬁdent
and capable of contributing at this particular level are
spread pretty thinly (NP22).
The resulting tendency to overuse the limited number of
consumers available was noted:
One of the biggest concerns that I had is that we have a
relatively small number of consumers who are willing and
able to do the job, and those people tend to get called
on a lot (NP3).
Isolation for a consumer educator was recognised and the
need for more than one consumer academic or representative emphasised by several participants:
If we could have more people involved and a group of
people making decisions rather than one person, I think
that would be a real beneﬁt (NP3).
As a desire to commence or increase the inclusion of consumer perspective in the education of nurses increased, this
shortage was becoming more apparent:

5
there just seems to be less consumers on the ground that
are able to participate (NP13).
Similarly:
trying to get a range of consumers and building a pool in
which to draw from can be quite difﬁcult (NP28).

4. Discussion
The National Practice Standards of the Mental Health Workforce published in 2002 (Commonwealth of Australia, 2002)
articulated a clear goal that consumers should be actively
involved in the education of health professionals. This goal
was shared by the Mental Health Nursing Education Taskforce
(Mental Health Nurse Education Taskforce, 2008) and should
therefore be an integral component of best practice in
undergraduate mental health nursing education or at a minimum be showing positive movement in that direction. The
literature suggests consumer involvement is not yet embedded in mental health nursing education at the undergraduate
level in Australia (Deakin University Human Services, 1999;
McCann et al., 2009) and the current project suggests a
similar picture is applicable to postgraduate curricula.
Given the ﬁrst consumer academic position was implemented in 2000 (Happell & Roper, 2009) and there have
only been two similar appointments in nursing programs in
Australia since, in 2010 and 2013 (these two academics work
at the same university), it is apparent that these positions
are currently not a high priority and are therefore unlikely
to proliferate without a strong commitment and strategic
approach to implementation. Such an approach requires
vision. Without vision there is a tendency to make decisions
based on constraints and limitations rather than identifying
the desired outcome and working towards making it a reality
(Happell, 2010).
The responses for nurse participants suggest that most
have a strong commitment to including or increasing consumer involvement in mental health nurse education. The
attitudes of mental health nurse academics to consumer
involvement in education remain relatively unexplored. One
source suggests they are generally favourable but describe
signiﬁcant barriers impeding their capacity to implement
consumer participation or increase what currently exists
(Happell, Wynaden et al., 2015). Reports and literature
show the amount of consumer participation in education
has gradually increased, albeit not substantially (Happell,
Platania-Phung et al., 2015; McCann et al., 2009; Mental
Health Nurse Education Taskforce, 2008), which would suggest at least a degree of commitment is evident. The current
project’s ﬁndings suggest the views of nurses tend to be
speciﬁcally focused on component parts of an academic
role such as teaching, laboratories and assessment. Few
participants described the role in a broader sense that
might facilitate strong consumer inﬂuence into the content,
design and pedagogical approach of mental health nursing
curricula.
The responses from consumer academics and educators
was in stark contrast, with clear visionary statements. Many
participants described their role being in relative isolation
from the broader curriculum, with little or no knowledge
of the broader picture. Where consumer involvement is
limited and isolated, the involvement is by deﬁnition essentially tokenistic (Anghel & Ramon, 2009; Forrest et al.,
2000; Meehan & Glover, 2007; Perry et al., 2013; Terry,
2012; Townend et al., 2008), thereby limiting the extent
that they can inﬂuence the attitudes of nursing students

and facilitate the achievement of mental health policy
goals.
Participants employed in designated consumer academic
roles described a much greater level of autonomy. Despite
this, they were all aware of the limits of their current roles.
Isolation was a particular consideration they raised. This is
not a topic commonly discussed in the literature in relation to these positions. In one Australian article (Happell
& Roper, 2006), the inequality experienced by people in
consumer roles in comparison to their colleagues from the
professions is raised as a fundamental concern. Not only are
consumers not readily able to work closely with and interact and exchange ideas with colleagues, they do not have
access to activities that encourage collegiality and networking, such as professional organisations, scholarly journals
and conferences. Both the formal and informal networks
academics enjoy are extremely important to their career
development (Adcroft & Taylor, 2013). Their absence for
consumers likely contributes to the strong sense of isolation
the participants describe in this research, and it also denies
the important opportunity for collaboration, networking and
the sharing of knowledge.
Maximising the contribution consumers can make to the
education of health professionals and the subsequently
positive inﬂuence on their attitudes, arguably requires a
collective body of knowledge and the ability to inﬂuence
what students are taught. Currently however, as described
by Felton and Stickley (2004) it is the nurse academics
who have power to determine whether consumers are
involved, to what degree and in what capacity. If organisations employ only one or two consumers, as is likely within
the current economic environment of universities, the subsequent ad hoc approach will not be sufﬁcient if meaningful
change is the desired outcome, and tokenism is to be
avoided.
The design and implementation of academic/educator
positions for consumers of mental health services must
move from the current thinking around involving consumers
to a partnership approach based on co-production. The
term co-production describes a fundamental shift in the
scientiﬁc paradigm approach to research, to a truly cooperative relationship between researchers representing the
health professions and those most affected by research
knowledge and outcomes, the consumers (Clifton, Repper,
Banks, & Remnant, 2013; Gillard et al., 2010; Gillard,
Simons, Turner, Lucock, & Edwards, 2012). Research teams
are not uni-disciplinary, they encompass a broad range
of expertise including experts by experience. The principles of co-production could be readily transferred into the
academic realm through education and research (Russo &
Beresford, 2014). Rather than nurses looking to involve consumers, the two perspectives would contribute to creating
a shared vision for quality mental health nursing education (Simpson, Reynolds, Light, & Attenborough, 2007) and
assist in preparing the mental health workforce for recoveryoriented practice (Walker, Perkins, & Repper, 2014).
Academic positions for mental health consumers has been
one strategy that has promoted consumer involvement at
a more autonomous level (Byrne, Happell, Platania-Phung,
Harris, & Bradshaw, 2014; Happell & Roper, 2009). It is likely
the failure of these positions to proliferate, represents at
least in part the complexity of the contemporary university
and in particular the implications of funding shortages
on the quality and quantity of academic staff (Williams,
2012). Financial constraints may encourage universities
and schools of nursing to focus on the delivery of what
is considered to be core business and therefore limit the
capacity for increased involvement of consumers, and

particularly for the introduction of dedicated academic
positions for consumers of mental health services.

4.1. Limitations
This study utilised a qualitative, exploratory approach.
Given the limited number of participants it cannot be conﬁdently asserted that similar ﬁndings would be realised were
the research conducted in different settings. The underrepresentation of the consumer voice in relation to the nurses
also presents a limitation. While mental health nurse academics are readily located via the Head of School or other
senior academic, consumers could only be contacted indirectly via the mental health nurse academic participants.
As the researchers were not privy to the communications
between them we are not clear whether the low response
is the result of lack of interest on the part of the consumers, or the information not being passed on by the
nurses. Further research would beneﬁt from alternative
approaches to the recruitment of consumers to enhance
the opportunity for their voice to be heard on these crucial
issues.

5. Conclusions
The importance of consumer involvement in the education
of nurses and other health professionals has been identiﬁed in mental health policy, reports regarding the education
of professional groups and in the broader literature. While
the limited evidence suggests consumer involvement in educating nurses is increasing, it remains for the most part,
ad hoc, minimal and frequently tokenistic. The need for
a visionary approach is essential if more promising results
are to be realised in the future. This vision would best be
realised through the principles of co-production, drawing
together the views, opinions and experiences of consumers
and nurses and working towards a shared approach. For
consumer knowledge to ﬂourish and develop in its own
right, resources must be devoted to providing opportunities
for consumer academics and educators to communicate, share knowledge and seek information and support
from their peers. Something most academics take for
granted.
